CHAPTER 1. Never Talk with Strangers       At the  hour of  the hot  spring  sunset two citizens appeared  at  thePatriarch's Ponds. One of them, approximately forty  years old, dressed in agrey summer  suit,  was  short,  dark-haired, plump, bald, and  carried  hisrespectable fedora hat in his hand. His neady shaven  face was adorned  withblack  horn-rimmed   glasses  of   a   supernatural  size.   The   odier,  abroad-shouldered  young  man  with tousled reddish  hair, his checkered  capcocked back on his head, was wearing a cowboy shirt, wrinkled white trousersand black sneakers.     The    first    was    none   other    than    Mikhail    AlexandrovichBerlioz,[2] editor of a  fat literary journal and chairman of theboard   of   one  of  the  major  Moscow   literary   associations,   calledMassolit[3] for short, and  his young companion was the poet IvanNikolaevich    Ponyrev,    who    wrote    under    the     pseudonym     ofHomeless.[4]     Once in the  shade of the barely greening  lindens, the writers  dashedfirst  thing  to a brighdypainted stand  with  the  sign:  'Beer  and  SoftDrinks.'     Ah, yes, note must  be made  of  the first oddity of this dreadful  Mayevening. There was not a single person  to be seen, not  only by  the stand,but  also along the whole walk  parallel to Malaya Bronnaya Street.  At thathour  when it seemed no longer possible  to breathe,  when  the sun,  havingscorched Moscow,  was  collapsing in  a dry  haze somewhere  beyond SadovoyeRing, no one  came under the lindens, no one  sat  on a bench, the  walk wasempty.     'Give us seltzer,' Berlioz asked.     'There is no seltzer,' die woman in the stand said, and for some reasonbecame offended.     'Is there beer?' Homeless inquired in a rasping voice.     'Beer'll be delivered towards evening,' the woman replied.     'Then what is there?' asked Berlioz.     'Apricot soda, only warm,' said the woman.     'Well, let's have it, let's have it! . . .'     The  soda  produced an abundance  of yellow foam,  and the air began tosmell of a  barber-shop. Having finished  drinking, the writers immediatelystarted to hiccup, paid, and sat down on a  bench face to the  pond and backto Bronnaya.     Here the second oddity  occurred,  touching Berlioz alone.  He suddenlystopped hiccuping, his heart gave a thump and dropped away  somewhere for aninstant, then came back, but with a blunt needle lodged in it. Besides that,Berlioz  was gripped by  fear, groundless, yet so  strong that  he wanted toflee the Ponds at once without looking back.     Berlioz looked around in anguish, not understanding what had frightenedhim. He paled, wiped his forehead with a handkerchief, thought:     "What's the matter with me? This has never happened before.  My heart'sacting up ...  I'm  overworked . .. Maybe it's time to send  it all  to  thedevil and go to Kislovodsk . . .'[5]     And here the  sweltering  air thickened before him, and  a  transparentcitizen  of  the  strangest  appearance wove himself  out  of  it. A  peakedjockey's cap on his little head, a  short checkered jacket also made of  air...  Acitizen seven feet tall, but  narrow  in the  shoulders, unbelievablythin, and, kindly note, with a jeering physiognomy.     The life of Berlioz had taken such a course that he was unaccustomed toextraordinary  phenomena. Turning  paler  still,  he  goggled  his eyes  andthought in consternation: 'This can't be! . . .'     But, alas, it was, and the long, see-through citizen was swaying beforehim to the left and to the right without touching the ground.     Here terror took such possession of Berlioz that he shut his eyes. Whenhe  opened them  again,  he  saw  that it  was  all over, the  phantasm  haddissolved, the checkered  one had  vanished, and with that  the blunt needlehad popped out of his heart.     'Pah, the  devil!' exclaimed the editor. 'YOU know, Ivan,  I nearly hadheatstroke just  now! There was even something like a hallucination . ..' Heattempted  to smile, but  alarm  still jumped  in  his eyes  and  his  handstrembled.  However,  he  gradually  calmed  down, fanned  himself  with  hishandkerchiefand, having  said rather cheerfully: 'Well, and so . . .', wenton with the conversation interrupted by their soda-drinking.     This conversation, as was learned afterwards, was  about Jesus  Christ.The  thing  was  that  the  editor  had  commissioned from the poet  a  longanti-religious poem for the next issue  of his journal. Ivan Nikolaevich hadwritten this poem,  and in a  very short time, but  unfortunately the editorwas not at all satisfied with it. Homeless had portrayed the  main characterof  his poem - that is, Jesus - in  very dark  colours, but nevertheless thewhole poem,  in the editor's opinion, had to be written  over again.  And sothe editor was now giving the poet something of a lecture on Jesus, with theaim of underscoring the poet's essential error.     It is hard to  say what precisely had let Ivan  Nikolaevich down -  thedescriptive powers of his talent or a total  unfamiliarity with the questionhe was writing about  - but  his Jesus came out, well, completely alive, theonce-existing  Jesus,though, true, a  Jesus  furnished  with  all  negativefeatures.     Now,  Berlioz wanted to prove to  the poet that  the main thing was nothow  Jesus was, good or  bad, but that this same Jesus,  as a person, simplynever existed in the world, and all the stories about him were mere fiction,the most ordinary mythology.     It  must  be  noted  that the  editor was a well-read  man  and  in hisconversation  very skilfully pointed to ancient  historians - for  instance,the famous Philo of Alexandria[6]  and  the brilliantly  educatedFlavius Josephus[7]  - who never  said a word about the existenceof Jesus. Displaying a solid erudition, Mikhail Alexandrovich  also informedthe poet, among other  things, that  the  passage in  the  fifteenth book ofTacitus's famous Annals,  the  forty-fourth chapter, where mention is made ofthe execution of Jesus, was nothing but a later spurious interpolation.     The poet,  for  whom  everything the editor  was telling  him was  new,listened attentively to Mikhail Alexandrovich, fixinghis pert green eyes onhim, and merely hiccuped from time  to  time, cursing the apricot soda underhis breath.     There's not a single Eastern  religion,' Berlioz was saying, 'in which,as a rule, an immaculate virgin did not give birth to a god. And in just thesame  wav,  without inventing  anything new,  the  Christians  created theirJesus, who in fact  never lived. It's on this that the main emphasis  shouldbe placed . . .'     Berlioz's high  tenor rang out in  the  deserted  walk,  and as MikhailAlexandrovich went deeper into  the maze, which only a highly  educated  mancan go into without risking a broken  neck, the poet learned  more and  moreinteresting and  useful things about  the Egyptian  Osiris,[9]  abenevolent god and the son of Heaven and Earth, and about the Phoenician godTammoz,[10] and  about Marduk,"  and  even about a  lesser known,terrible  god, Vitzliputzli,'[2] once greatly  venerated  by  theAztecs  in Mexico. And  just at  the  moment  when Mikhail Alexandrovich wastelling the poethow the Aztecs  used to  fashion figurines of Vitzli-putzliout of dough -- the first man appeared in the walk.     Afterwards,  when, frankly  speaking, it  was already too late, variousinstitutions  presented  reports  describing this man. A  comparison of themcannot  but cause  amazement. Thus, the first of them said that the  man wasshort, had gold teeth, and limped on his right leg. The second, that the manwas enormously tall, had platinum crowns, and  limped on his  left leg.  Thethird  laconically averred that the man had no distinguishing marks. It mustbe acknowledged that none of these reports is of any value.     First of  all, the  man described  did  not  limp on  any leg,  and wasneither  short  nor  enormous, but  simply  tall. As for his  teeth, he  hadplatinum crowns on the left side and gold  on the  right.  He was wearing anexpensive  grey suit and imported shoes of a matching colour. His grey beretwas cocked rakishly over  one ear; under his arm 1-e  carried a stick with ablack knob shaped  like a poodle's head.[13]  He looked to  be alittle over forty. Mouth somehow  twisted. Clean-shaven. Dark-haired.  Righteye black, left -- for some  reason  -- green. Dark eyebrows, but one higherthan the other. In short, a foreigner.[14]     Having passed  by  the  bench  on which  the  editor  and the poet wereplaced,  the foreigner gave them a sidelong look, stopped,  and suddenly satdown on the next bench, two steps away from the friends.     'A  German  . . .'  thought Berlioz. 'An  Englishman  .  .  .'  thoughtHomeless. 'My, he must be hot in those gloves.'     And the foreigner gazed around at the tall buildings that rectangularlyframed the  pond,  making it obvious that he was seeing  the  place  for thefirst time and that  it  interested him. He  rested  his glance on the upperfloors, where the glass dazzlinglv reflected the broken-up sun which was forever departing from  Mikhail  Alexandrovich, then  shifted it lower down  towhere  the  windows   were  beginning  to   darken  before  evening,  smiledcondescendinglyat something, narrowed his eves, put his  hands on  the knoband his chin on his hands.     'For instance, Ivan,'  Berlioz was saying, 'you  portrayed the birth ofJesus, the son of God, very well and satirically, but the gist of it is thata whole series  of  sons  of  God were  born before  Jesus,  like,  say, thePhoenician  Adonis,[15]  the  Phrygian  Atris,[16] thePersian Mithras.[17] And, to put it briefly, not one of them  wasborn or  ever existed, Jesus included, and what's necessary is that, insteadof  portraying his birth or, suppose, the coming of the Magi,'[8]you portray the absurd  rumours  of their coming. Otherwise  it follows fromyour story that he really was born! . . .'     Here Homeless made an attempt to  stop his painful hiccuping by holdinghis breath, which caused him  to  hiccup more painfully  and loudly,  and atthat same moment  Berlioz interrupted  his  speech,  because  the  foreignersuddenly got  up  and  walked towards the writers. They  looked  at  him  insurprise.     'Excuse me, please,'the approaching man began speaking, with a foreignaccent but without distorting the words, 'if, not being your acquaintance, Iallow  myself...  but  the  subject  of  your  learned  conversation  is  sointeresting that. . .'     Here he politely  took off his beret, and the friends  had nothing leftbut to stand up and make their bows.     'No, rather a Frenchman .. .' thought Berlioz.      'A Pole? . . .' thought Homeless.     It  must be added that  from  his  first  words  the  foreigner made  arepellent impression on the  poet, but Berlioz rather liked  him  - that is,not liked but ... how to put it ... was interested, or whatever.     'May I sit down?' the foreigner asked politely, and the friends somehowinvoluntarily  moved apart; the foreigner adroidy sat down between them  andat once entered into the conversation:     'Unless I  heard  wrong,  you  were  pleased to say  that  Jesus  neverexisted?' the foreigner asked, turning his green left eye to Berlioz.     'No,  you did  not hear wrong,' Berlioz  replied courteously, 'that isprecisely what I was saying.'     'Ah, how interesting!' exclaimed the foreigner.     'What the devil does he want?' thought Homeless, frowning.     'And you were agreeing with  your interlocutor?' inquired the stranger,turning to Homeless on his right.     'A hundred per cent!' confirmed the man, who was fond  of whimsical andfigurative expressions.     'Amazing!' exclaimed the uninvited interlocutor and, casting a thievishglance around and muffling his low voice for some reason, he said:     'Forgive my  importunity,  but, as I  understand, along with everythingelse, you also do not believe in  God?' tie made frightened  eyes and added:'I swear I won't tell anyone!'     'No, we don't believe in God,' Berlioz replied, smiling slightly at theforeign tourist's fright, but we can speak of it quite freely.'     The  foreigner  sat  back on the  bench and  asked, even  with a slightshriek of curiosity:     'You are - atheists?!'     Yes,  we're atheists,' Berlioz smilingly replied, and Homelessthought,getting angry: 'Latched on to us, the foreign goose!'     'Oh,  how  lovely!'  the  astonishing  foreigner  cried out  and  beganswivelling his head, looking from one writer to the other.     'In our country atheism does not surprise  anyone,' Berlioz  said  withdiplomatic politeness.  'The majority of our population consciously and longago ceased believing in the fairytales about God.'     Here the foreigner pulled the following stunt: he got up and  shook theamazed editor's hand, accompanying it with these words:     'Allow me to thank you with all my  heart!' 'What are you  thanking himfor?' Homeless  inquired,  blinking.  'For some very important  information,which is  of great interest  to me as  a traveller,'  the outlandish  fellowexplained, raising his finger significantly.     The  important  information  apparendy  had  indeed  produced  a strongimpression  on  the traveller, because he passed his  frightened glance overthe buildings, as if afraid of seeing an atheist in every window.     'No,he's not an Englishman ...' thought Berlioz, and Homeless thought:'Where'd he pick up  his Russian, that's the interesting thing!' and frownedagain.     'But, allow  me to  ask  you,'  the  foreign visitor spoke  after  someanxious reflection, 'what, then, about the  proofs  of  God's existence,  ofwhich, as is known, there are exactly five?'     'Alas!'  Berlioz said  with regret. 'Not one of these  proofs  is worthanything, and  mankind shelved them  long  ago. You  must agree that  in therealm of reason there can be no proof of God's existence.'     'Bravo!' cried  the  foreigner.  'Bravo!  You have  perfectly  repeatedrestless  old Immanuel's[19] thought  in this regard. But  here'sthe hitch: he roundly demolished all five proofs,  and then, as  if  mockinghimself, constructed a sixth of his own.'     'Kant's proof,' the learned  editor  objected with  a subtle smile, 'isequally  unconvincing. Not for nothing  did  Schiller say that  the  Kantianreasoning  on this  question can  satisfy  only  slaves, and Strauss simplylaughed at this proof.' Berlioz spoke, thinking all the while: 'But, anyhow,who is he? And why does he speak Russian so well?'     They  ought to  take  this  Kant and  give him a three-year stretch  inSolovki[22] for  such  proofs!'  Ivan Nikolaevich  plumped  quiteunexpectedly.     'Ivan!' Berlioz whispered, embarrassed.     But the suggestion of sending Kant  to Solovki  not only  did not shockthe foreigner, but even sent him into raptures.     'Precisely,  precisely,' he cried, and his  green left  eye, turned  toBerlioz, flashed. 'Just the  place  for him! Didn't I tell  him that time atbreakfast:     "As  you  will.  Professor, but what  you've thought  up  doesn't  hangtogether. It's clever, maybe, but mighty unclear. You'll be laughed at."'     Berlioz goggled his eyes. 'At breakfast...  to Kant? . . . What is thisdrivel?' he thought.     'But,' the  oudander went on,  unembarrassed by Berlioz's amazement andaddressing  the poet, 'sending him to Solovki  is unfeasible, for the simplereason that  he has been abiding for  over  a  hundred years now in  placesconsiderably more remote  than Solovki, and to extract him from  there is inno way possible, I assure you.'     'Too bad!' the feisty poet responded.     'Yes, too bad!' the stranger agreed, his eye flashing, and went on:     'But here is a question that is troubling me: if there is no God, then,one may  ask,  who governs human life and, in  general, the  whole  order ofthings on earth?'     'Man governs  it himself,' Homeless angrily  hastened to reply  to thisadmittedly none-too-clear question.     'Pardon  me,' the  stranger responded gently, 'but in  order to govern,one  needs,  after  all,  to have a  precise plan  for  a  certain, at leastsomewhat  decent,  length of time.  Allow me to ask you, then, how  can  mangovern, if  he is not only deprived of the opportunity of making a  plan forat least some ridiculously short period - well, say, a thousand years -  butcannot even vouch for his own tomorrow?     'And  in fact,' here the strangerturned to Berlioz, 'imagine that you,for  instance,  start  governing,  giving  orders  to  others  and yourself,generally, so to  speak, acquire a taste for it, and suddenly you get ...hem... hem ... lung  cancer ...'  -- here the  foreigner smiled sweetly, and ifthe thought of lung cancer  gave him pleasure -- 'yes, cancer'  -- narrowinghis eyes like a cat, he repeated the sonorous word -- 'and so your governingis over!     'You are no  longer  interested  in  anyone's fate  but  your own. Yourfamily starts lying  to  you. Feeling that something is wrong, you  rush  tolearned doctors, then to quacks,  and sometimes  to fortune-tellers as well.Like  the first, so the second  and third are completely  senseless, as  youunderstand.  And it all ends tragically: a man who still recently thought hewas governing something, suddenly winds up lying motionless in a wooden box,and the people around him, seeing that the man lying there is no longer goodfor anything, burn him in an oven.     'And sometimes it's worse still:the man  has  just  decided  to  go toKislovodsk' - here the foreigner  squinted at Berlioz  - 'a trifling matter,it seems, but even this he cannot accomplish, because suddenly, no one knowswhy, he slips and falls under a tram-car! Are you going to say it was he whogoverned himself that way? Would it not be more correct to think that he wasgoverned by  someone else entirely?' And  here  the unknown man burst into astrange little laugh.     Berlioz listened with great attention to the unpleasant story about thecancer and the tram-car, and certain alarming thoughts began to torment him.'He's not a foreigner .. . he's not a foreigner . ..'  he  thought,  'he's amost peculiar specimen ... but, excuse me, who is he then?...'     You'd  like  to   smoke,  I  see?'   the  stranger  addressed  Homelessunexpectedly. "Which kind do you prefer?'     'What, have you got several?' the poet, who  had run out of cigarettes,asked glumly.     'Which do you prefer?' the stranger repeated.     'Okay -- Our Brand,' Homeless repliedspitefully.     The unknown man immediately  took  a cigarette case from his pocket andoffered it to Homeless:     'Our Brand . . .'     Editor and  poet were  both struck, not so much by Our  Brand preciselyturning up in the cigarette case, as by the cigarette case itself. It was ofhuge  size,  made  of pure gold, and,  as it was opened, a  diamond triangleflashed white and blue fire on its lid.     Here the writers  thought differently. Berlioz: 'No, a foreigner!', andHomeless: 'Well, devil take him, eh!...'     The poet and the owner of the cigarette case lit up, but the non-smokerBerlioz declined.     'I must counter him like  this,' Berlioz decided, 'yes, man  is mortal,no one disputes that. But the thing is . ..'     However, before he managed to utter these words, the foreigner spoke:     'Yes, man is mortal, but that would be only half the trouble. The worstof  it is  that he's sometimes unexpectedly mortal -- there's the trick! Andgenerally he's unable to say what he's going to do this same evening.'    'What  an absurd way of putting  the question ...' Berlioz  thought andobjected:     'Well,  there's some  exaggeration here. About  this same evening I  doknow more or less certainly. It goes without  saying, if a brick should fallon my head on Bronnaya . . '     'No brick,' the  stranger interrupted imposingly,  'will ever  fall  onanyone's head just out of  the blue. In this particular case, I assure  you,you are not in danger of that at all. You will die a different death.'     'Maybe you know what kind precisely?' Berlioz  inquired with  perfectlynatural irony, getting drawn into an utterly  absurd conversation. 'And willtell me?'     'Willingly,' the unknown man responded. He  looked Berlioz up and  downas if he were going to make him a suit, muttered through his teeth somethinglike: 'One, two . . . Mercury in the second house . . . moon gone ...  six -disaster .  . .  evening - seven  . . .' then announced loudly and joyfully:'Your head will be cut off!'     Homeless  goggled his  eyes wildly  and  spitefullyat  the  insouciantstranger, and Berlioz asked, grinning crookedly:     'By whom precisely? Enemies? Interventionists?'[23]     'No,' replied his interlocutor, 'by a Russian woman, a Komsomol[24]girl.'     'Hm .  . .' Berlioz mumbled, vexed at the stranger's Utde joke,  'well,excuse me, but that's not very likely.'     'And I beg you  to excuse me,' the foreigner replied, 'but it's so. Ah,yes, I  wanted to ask you, what are you  going to do tonight,  if it's not asecret?'     'It's  not a  secret. Right now I'll  stop by my place on Sadovaya, andthen  at ten this evening there  will be  a meeting at Massolit, and  I willchair it.'     'No, that simply cannot be,' the foreigner objected firmly.     'Why not?'     'Because,'  the foreigner replied  and, narrowing his eyes, looked intothe  sky, where,  anticipating  the  cool of  the evening, black  birds weretracing noiselessly, 'Annushka has already bought the sunflower oil, and hasnot only bought it, but has already spilled it. So the meeting will not takeplace.'    Here, quite understandably, silence fell under the lindens.     'Forgive  me,'  Berlioz  spoke   after  a   pause,   glancing   at  thedrivel-spouting foreigner, 'but what has sunflower oil got to do with it ...and which Annushka?'     'Sunflower oil has  got  this to do with it,'  Homeless suddenly spoke,obviously  deciding to declare war on the uninvited  interlocutor. 'Have youever happened, citizen, to be in a hospital for the mentally ill?'     'Ivan!.. .' Mikhail Alexandrovich exclaimed quietly. But  the foreignerwas not a bit offended and burst into the merriest laughter.     'I have,  I have,  and more than once!' he  cried  out,  laughing,  butwithout  taking his unlaughing eye off the poet. 'Where haven't I been! Onlyit's too bad I didn't get around to asking the professor  what schizophreniais. So you will have to find that out from him yourself, Ivan Nikolaevich!'     'How do you know my name?'     'Gracious, Ivan Nikolaevich, who doesn't  know you?' Here the foreignertook out of his pocket the previousday's issue of the Literary Gazette,  andIvan Nikolaevich saw his own picture on the very first page and under it hisvery own  verses. But the proof  of fame and popularity, which yesterday haddelighted the poet, this time did not delight him a bit.     'Excuse me,' he said, and his face darkened, 'could you wait one littlemoment? I want to sav a couple of words to my friend.'     'Oh, with pleasure!' exclaimed the stranger. 'It's so nice  here  underthe lindens, and, by the way, I'm not in any hurry.'     'Listen here,  Misha,' the poet whispered, drawing Berlioz aside, 'he'sno foreign  tourist, he's  a spy.  A Russian  emigre[25] who  hascrossed back over. Ask for his papers before he gets away...'     'YOU think  so?'  Berlioz whispered worriedly, and thought: 'Why,  he'sright...'     'Believe me,' the poet  rasped  into his ear,  'he's pretending to be afool in  order to  find  out  something or other. Just  hear how  he  speaksRussian.'  As  he spoke, the poet  kept glancing sideways, to  make sure thestrangerdid not escape. 'Let's go and detain him, or he'll get away . . .'     And the poet pulled Berlioz back to the bench by the arm.     The unknown man  was not sitting, but was  standing near it, holding inhis hands some booklet in a dark-grey  binding, a  sturdy  envelope  made ofgood paper, and a visiting card.     'Excuse  me  for  having forgotten,  in  the  heat of our  dispute,  tointroduce myself. Here is my card, my passport, and an invitation to come toMoscow for a consultation,' the stranger said weightily, giving both writersa penetrating glance.     They  were embarrassed. 'The devil, he  heard everything .. .'  Berliozthought, and with  a polite gesture indicated that there was no need to showpapers. While the foreigner was pushing them at the editor, the poet managedto  make out the word  'Professor'  printed in foreign type on the card, andthe initial letter of the last name - a double 'V' - 'W'.     'My  pleasure,' the editor meanwhile muttered in embarrassment, and theforeigner put the papers backin his pocket.     Relations were  thus  restored, and  all three sat  down  on  the benchagain.     'You've been invited here as a consultant. Professor?' asked Berlioz.     'Yes, as a consultant.'     "You're German?' Homeless inquired.     'I? . ..' the professor repeated and suddenly fell  to  thinking. 'Yes,perhaps I am German .. .' he said.     'YOU speak real good Russian,' Homeless observed.     'Oh,  I'm generally a polyglot and know a  great number of  languages,'the professor replied.     'And what is your field?' Berlioz inquired.     'I am a specialist in black magic.'     There he goes!...' struck in Mikhail Alexandrovich's head.     'And . ..  and you've  been invited  here in that capacity?' he  asked,stammering.     'Yes, in that capacity,' the professor confirmed,  and explained: 'In astate  library   here   some   original  manuscripts  of  the  tenth-centurynecromancer Gerbert of Aurillac[26] have  been  found. So  it  isnecessary for me to sort them out. I am the only specialist in theworld.'     'Aha! You're a historian?' Berlioz asked with great relief and respect.     'I am a historian,' the scholar confirmed, and added with  no rhyme  orreason: This evening there will be an interesting story at the Ponds!'     Once again editor and poet were  extremely surprised, but the professorbeckoned them both to him, and when they leaned towards him, whispered:     'Bear in mind that Jesus did exist.'     'You  see. Professor,' Berlioz  responded  with  a  forced  smile,  'werespect  your great  learning, but  on this question we hold  to a differentpoint of view.'     'There's  no  need  for  any  points  of view,'  the  strange professorreplied, 'he simply existed, that's all.'     'But there's need for some proof. . .' Berlioz began. "There's  no needfor any  proofs,' replied the professor, and he began to speak softly, whilehis accent for  some reason disappeared: 'It's all  very simple: In a  whitecloak with blood-red lining, with  the shuffling gait of a cavalryman, earlyin the  morningof  the fourteenth  day  of  the  spring month of Nisan .  .,'[27]
CHAPTER 2. Pontius Pilate        In a white cloak  with  blood-red lining, with the shuffling gait of  acavalryman, early in the morning of  the fourteenth day of  the spring monthof  Nisan, there came out to the  covered colonnade between the two wings ofthe  palace  of  Herod  the Great'  the  procurator of  Judea,[2]Pontius Pilate.[3]     More than  anything in the world the procurator hated the smell of roseoil, and  now  everything foreboded a bad  day, because this smell had  beenpursuing the procurator since dawn.     It seemed to the procurator that a rosy smell exuded from the cypressesand palms in the garden, that the smell of leather trappings and sweat  fromthe convoy was mingled with the cursed rosy flux.     From the outbuildings at the back of the palace, where the first cohortof  the  Twelfth  Lightning   legion,[4]  which   had   come   toYershalaim[5  ]with the  procurator, was  quartered, a  whiff  ofsmoke reached the colonnade across the upper terrace of the palace, and thisslightly acrid  smoke, which testifiedthat the centuries'  mess  cooks  hadbegun to prepare dinner, was mingled with the same thick rosy scent.     'Oh, gods, gods, why do you punish me? . . . Yes, no doubt, this is it,this  is it again, the  invincible, terrible illness  . .. hemicrania,  whenhalf of the  head aches .  . . there's no remedy for it,  no escape ... I'lltry not to move my head . . .'     On the mosaic floor by the fountain a chair was  already  prepared, andthe  procurator, without looking at anyone, sat in  it and reached his  handout to one side. His secretary  deferentially placed a sheet of parchment inthis  hand.  Unable to  suppress  a painful  grimace,  the procurator  ran acursory, sidelong  glance over the writing,  returned the  parchment  to thesecretary, and said with difficulty:     "The  accused is from  Galilee?[6] Was  the case sent to thetetrarch?'     'Yes, Procurator,' replied the secretary.     'And what then?'     'He   refused  to   make  a   decision  on  the   case   and  sent  theSanhedrin's[7  ]death  sentenceto  you  for  confirmation,'  thesecretary explained.     The procurator twitched his cheek and said quietly:     'Bring in the accused.'     And at once two legionaries brought  a  man of about twenty-seven  fromthe garden terrace to the balcony under the columns and stood him before theprocurator's  chair.  The man  was  dressed  in  an  old and torn light-bluechiton. His head was covered by a white cloth with a leather band around theforehead, and his hands were bound behind his back. Under the man's left eyethere was a large bruise, in the corner of his mouth a cut caked with blood.The man gazed at the procurator with anxious curiosity.     The latter paused, then asked quiedy in Aramaic:[8]     'So  it was  you  who  incited  the people  to  destroy  the temple  ofYershalaim?'[9]     The procurator  sat  as if made of stone  while he spoke,  and only hislips moved slighdy as he pronounced the words. The procurator was as if madeof stone because he was afraid to move his head, aflame with infernal pain.    The man with bound hands leaned forward somewhat and began to speak:     'Good man! Believe me . ..'     But me procurator, motionless as  before and not  raising  his voice inthe least, straight away interrupted him:     'Is it  me that  you are  calling a good man? You are mistaken.  It  iswhispered about me in Yershalaim that  I am a fierce monster,  and  that  isperfecdv correct.' And he  added in the same monotone: 'Bring the  centurionRatslayer.'     It  seemed  to everyone that  it became  darker on the balcony when thecenturion of the first century. Mark, nicknamed Ratslayer, presented himselfbefore the  procurator. Ratslayer was a head taller than the tallest soldierof  the  legion and so broad in the shoulders that he completely blocked outthe still-low sun.     The procurator addressed the centurion in Latin:     'The  criminal calls me "good  man".  Take  him  outside  for a moment,explain to him how I ought to be spoken to. But no maiming.'     And  everyone except the motionless procuratorfollowed  Mark Ratslayerwith their  eyes as  he motioned  to the  arrested man,  indicating  that heshould go  with him. Everyone  generally  followed Ratslayer with their eyeswherever he  appeared, because of his height, and  those who were seeing himfor the first  time  also  because the centurion's face was  disfigured: hisnose had once been smashed by a blow from a Germanic club.     Mark's heavy boots thudded across the mosaic, the bound man noiselesslywent  out with  him, complete  silence fell  in the colonnade, and one couldhear pigeons cooing on the garden terrace near the balcony and water singingan intricate, pleasant song in the fountain.     The procurator would have liked to get  up, put  his  temple  under thespout, and stay standing that way. But he knew that even that would not helphim.     Having  brought the arrested  man  from under the columns  out  to  thegarden, Ratslayer took a whip from the hands of a legionary who was standingat the foot of a bronze statue and, swinging easily, struckthe arrested manacross the shoulders. The centurion's movement was casual and light, yet thebound man instantly collapsed on the ground as if his legs had been cut fromunder him; he gasped for ait, the colour drained from his face, and his eyeswent vacant.     With his left hand only. Mark heaved the fallen man  into the air  likean empty sack, set him on his feet,  and spoke nasally, in poorly pronouncedAramaic:     The Roman  procurator  is  called Hegemon.[10] Use  no otherwords. Stand at attention. Do you understand me, or do I hit you?'     The arrested man swayed, but  got hold of himself, his colour returned,he caught his breath and answered hoarsely:     T understand. Don't beat me.'     A moment later he was again standing before the procurator.     A lustreless, sick voice sounded:     'Name?'     'Mine?' the arrested  man hastily responded, his whole being expressinga readiness to answer sensibly, without provoking further wrath.     The procurator said softly:     'I know my own. Don't pretend to bestupider than you are. Yours.'     'Yeshua,'" the prisoner replied prompdy.     'Any surname?'     'Ha-Nozri.'     'Where do you come from?'     The town  of Gamala,'[12] replied  the  prisoner, indicatingwith his head that  there, somewhere far off to his right, in the north, wasthe town of Gamala.     'Who are you by blood?'     'I don't know exactly,' the arrested man  replied animatedly,  'I don'tremember my parents. I was told that my father was a Syrian . . .'     "Where is your permanent residence?'     'I have no permanent home,' the prisoner answered shyly, 'I travel fromtown to town.'     That  can be  put more briefly,  in a word - a vagrant,' the procuratorsaid, and asked:     'Any family?'     "None. I'm alone in the world.'     'Can you read and write?'     'Yes.'     'Do you know any language besides Aramaic?'     'Yes. Greek.'     A swollen eyelid rose, an eye clouded with suffering fixed the arrestedman. The other eye remained shut.     Pilate spoke in Greek.     'So it was you whowas going to destroy  the temple building and calledon the people to do that?'     Here the prisoner again became animated, his eyes ceased  to show fear,and he spoke in Greek:     'Never, goo ..  .' Here terror flashed in the prisoner's eyes,  becausehe had nearly made a slip. 'Never, Hegemon,  never in my life was I going todestroy the temple building, nor did I incite anyone to this senseless act.'     Surprise showed on the face of the  secretary, hunched over a low tableand writing down the testimony. He raised his head, but immediately bent  itto the parchment again.     'All sorts of people gather  in this  town for  the  feast. Among  themthere are  magicians,  astrologers,  diviners and murderers,' the procuratorspoke in  monotone, 'and  occasionally also liars. You, for instance, are  aliar. It is written  clearly: "Incited to destroy the  temple".  People havetestified to it.'     These good people,' the prisoner spoke and, hastily  adding  'Hegemon',went on: '... haven't any learning and haveconfused everything I told them.Generally, I'm beginning  to be afraid that this confusion may go  on for  avery long time. And all because he writes down the things I say incorrecdy.'     Silence fell. By now both sick eyes rested heavily on the prisoner.     'I repeat  to you, but for the last time, stop pretending that you're amadman,  robber,' Pilate  said softly and  monotonously, 'there's  not  muchwritten in your record, but what there is is enough to hang you.'     'No, no, Hegemon,'  the arrested man  said,  straining  all over in hiswish to  convince,  'there's  one with a goatskin parchment who  follows me,follows me and keeps writing  all  the  time. But once  I  peeked  into thisparchment and was  horrified.  I said  decidedly nothing  of what's  writtenthere. I implored him:  "Burn your parchment, I beg you!" But he tore it outof my hands and ran away.'     'Who is that?' Pilate asked squeamishly and touched his temple with hishand.     'Matthew Levi,'[13]  the prisoner  explained  willingly.'Heused  to  be  a  tax  collector,  and  I  first  met  him  on  the  road  inBethphage,'[4] where a fig grove juts out at an angle, and  I gotto talking with him. He treated me hostilely at first and even insulted me -that is,  thought  he insulted me -- by calling me a dog.' Here the prisonersmiled. 'I  personally see nothing bad  about this animal, that I should  beoffended by this word . . .'     The secretary  stopped writing  and stealthily cast a surprised glance,not at the arrested man, but at the procurator.     '. . . However, after listening to me, he began to soften,' Yeshua wenton,  'finally  threw  the  money down  in  the  road  and said  he would  gojourneying with me . . .'     Pilate grinned  with one cheek, baring yellow  teeth, and said, turninghis whole body towards the secretary:     'Oh, city ofYershalaim! What does  one not hear in it! A tax collector,do you hear, threw money down in the road!'     Not  knowing how to reply to that, the secretary found it necessary  torepeat Pilate's smile.    'He  said that  henceforth money  had  become hateful to  him,'  Yeshuaexplained Matthew Levi's strange  action and added: 'And since  then  he hasbeen my companion.'     His teeth still bared, the procurator glanced at the arrested man, thenat the sun, steadily  rising over the equestrian statues  of the hippodrome,which lay far below to the right, and  suddenly,  in some sickening anguish,thought that the  simplest thing would be to drive  this strange  robber offthe balcony by uttering just two words: 'Hang him.' To drive the convoy awayas  well,  to leave  the  colonnade,  go into  the  palace,  order  the roomdarkened,  collapse on the  bed,  send for cold  water, call in a  plaintivevoice  for his  dog Banga, and complain to him about the hemicrania. And thethought of poison suddenly flashed temptingly in the procurator's sick head,     He gazed  with dull eyes at the arrested man and was silent for a time,painfully trying to  remember  why there stood  before  him in  the pitilessmorning  sunlight of Yershalaim this prisoner with  his face disfigured  bybeating, and what other utterly unnecessary questions he had to ask him.     'Matthew Levi?' the sick  man asked  in  a hoarse voice and closed  hiseyes.     'Yes, Matthew Levi,' the high, tormenting voice came to him.     'And  what was it in  any case that  you  said  about the temple to thecrowd in the bazaar?'     The   responding   voice   seemed  to  stab  at  Pilate's  temple,  wasinexpressibly painful, and this voice was saying:     'I said, Hegemon, that the temple of the old faith would fall and a newtemple of truth would be built. I  said it that way so  as to make  it  moreunderstandable.'     'And why did you stir up the people in the bazaar, you vagrant, talkingabout the truth, of which you have no notion? What is truth?'[15]     And here the  procurator thought: 'Oh,   my  gods!  I'm asking him aboutsomething unnecessary at a trial... my reason no longer serves me . . .' Andagain he pictured a cup of dark liquid. 'Poison, bring me poison . . .'     And againhe heard the voice:     The  truth is, first of all, that your head  aches, and aches so  badlythat  you're having  faint-hearted thoughts of death. You're not only unableto speak to me, but it is even hard for you to look at me. And I am now yourunwilling torturer, which upsets me. You can't even think about anything andonly dream  that  your dog should  come,  apparently the one being  you  areattached  to.  But your suffering will soon  be  over, your headache will goaway.'     The secretary  goggled his  eyes at the prisoner and stopped writing inmid-word.     Pilate raised his tormented eyes to the  prisoner and saw  that the sunalready stood quite high over the hippodrome, that a  ray had penetrated thecolonnade and  was stealing  towards Yeshua's worn sandals, and that the manwas trying to step out of the sun's way.     Here  the  procurator rose  from his chair, clutched his  head with hishands,  and his  yellowish,  shaven face expressed dread.  But  he instantlysuppressed it with his will and loweredhimself into his chair again.     The prisoner  meanwhile continued his speech, but the  secretary was nolonger writing it down, and only stretched his neck like a goose, trying notto let drop a single word.     'Well,  there,   it's  all  over,'  the  arrested  man  said,  glancingbenevolently  at Pilate,  'and  I'm  extremely glad  of  it. I'd advise you,Hegemon,  to leave the palace for  a while and go  for a stroll somewhere inthe vicinity - say, in the gardens on the Mount of  Olives.[16] Astorm  will come  .  . .'  the prisoner turned,  narrowing  his eyes at  thesun,'... later on, towards evening. A stroll would  do  you much good, and Iwould be  glad to accompany  you. Certain new thoughts  have occurred to me,which I think you might find interesting, and I'd willingly  share them withyou, the more  so as  you  give the  impression of being a very  intelligentman.'     The secretary turned deathly pale and dropped the scroll on the floor.     'The trouble is,' the  bound man  went on, not stopped by anyone,'thatyou are too closed  off and have definitively lost faith in people. You mustagree,  one  can't  place  all  one's  affection  in  a  dog.  Your  life isimpoverished, Hegemon.' And here the speaker allowed himself to smile.     The  secretary now  thought of  only one thing, whether to  believe hisears or  not. He had to believe.  Then he  tried to  imagine precisely  whatwhimsical form the  wrath of the  hot-tempered procurator would take at thisunheard-of impudence from the prisoner. And this the secretary was unable toimagine, though he knew the procurator well.     Then came  the  cracked, hoarse  voice of the procurator, who  said  inLatin:     'Unbind his hands.'     One of the  convoy  legionaries rapped with  his  spear, handed  it  toanother, went over and took the ropes off the prisoner. The secretary pickedup his scroll, having decided to record nothing for now, and to be surprisedat nothing.     'Admit,'  Pilate  asked   softly  in  Greek,  'that  you  are  a  greatphysician?'     'No,  Procurator, I  am  not  a  physician,'   the  prisoner  replied,delightedly rubbing a crimped and swollen purple wrist.     Scowling deeply,  Pilate  bored the prisoner with  his eyes, and  theseeyes were no longer dull, but flashed with sparks familiar to all.     'I didn't ask you,' Pilate said, 'maybe you also know Latin?'     'Yes, I do,' the prisoner replied.     Colour came to Pilate's yellowish cheeks, and he asked in Latin:     'How did you know I wanted to call my dog?'     'It's very simple,'  the prisoner replied  in  Latin. 'YOU  were movingyour hand in the air' -- and the prisoner  repeated Pilate's gesture --  'asif you wanted to stroke something, and your lips . . .'     'Yes,' said Pilate.     There was silence. Then Pilate asked a question in Greek:     'And so, you are a physician?'     'No,  no,' the prisoner  replied  animatedly, 'believe  me,  I'm  not aphysician.'     Very  well,  then,  if you want to keep it a  secret,  do so. It has nodirect  bearing on the case. So you maintain that you did not incite anyoneto destroy ... or set fire to, or in any other way demolish the temple?'     'I  repeat, I did not  incite  anyone to such acts, Hegemon.  Do I looklike a halfwit?'     'Oh, no,  you don't look like a halfwit,' the procurator replied quiedyand smiled some strange smile. 'Swear, men, that it wasn't so.'     'By  what do  you  want  me  to  swear?' the unbound  man  asked,  veryanimated.     'Well,  let's  say, by  your life,'  the procurator replied. 'It's hightime you swore by it, since it's hanging by a hair, I can tell you.'     'You don't think it was you who hung it, Hegemon?' the  prisoner asked.'If so, you are very mistaken.'     Pilate gave a start and replied through his teeth:     'I can cut that hair.'     'In  that,  too, you  are  mistaken,'  the  prisoner  retorted, smilingbrightly and  shielding himself from  the sun with his hand. 'YOU must agreethat surely only he who hung it can cut the hair?'     'So,  so,'  Pilate said, smiling, 'now I  have no doubts that  the idleloafers of Yershalaimfollowed at your heels. I don't know  who hung  such atongue on you, but he hung it  well.  Incidentally, tell me, is it true thatyou  entered  Yershalaim  by  the  Susa  gate[17]  riding  on  anass,[18  ]accompanied   by  a  crowd  of  riff-raff  who  shoutedgreetings to  you as some  kind of  prophet?' Here the procurator pointed tothe parchment scroll.     The prisoner glanced at the procurator in perplexity.     'I don't even have an ass, Hegemon,' he said. 'I  did enter  Yershalaimby the Susa gate, but on foot, accompanied only by Matthew Levi, and no  oneshouted anything to me, because no one in Yershalaim knew me then.'     'Do you  happen to know,' Pilate continued wimout taking  his  eyes offthe  prisoner, 'such  men  as a certain Dysmas, another named  Gestas, and athird named Bar-Rabban?'[19]     'I do not know these good people,' the prisoner replied.     Truly?'     Truly.'     'And now tell me, why is it that you use me words "good people" all thetime? Do you call everyone that, or what?'    'Everyone,' the  prisoner  replied.  There  are no  evil people  in theworld.'     The first I hear of it,' Pilate said, grinning. 'But perhaps I know toolittle  of  life!  ..  .  You  needn't record  any  more,'  he addressed thesecretary, who had  not recorded  anything anyway, and went on  talking withthe prisoner. 'YOU read that in some Greek book?'     'No, I figured it out for myself.'     'And you preach it?'     'Yes.'     'But  take,  for  instance,  the  centurion  Mark,  the  one  known  asRat-slayer - is he good?'     'Yes,' replied the prisoner. True,  he's an unhappy man. Since the goodpeople disfigured him, he has  become cruel and hard. I'd be curious to knowwho maimed him.'     'I can willingly tell you that,' Pilate responded, 'for I was a witnessto it. The good people  fell on him like dogs on  a bear. There were German!fastened  on  his  neck,  his  arms,  his  legs.  The  infantry maniple  wasencircled, and if one flank hadn't been  cut by a cavalry turm,  of  which Iwas  the  commander -- you, philosopher, would not  have had the  chance tospeak   with    the    Ratslayer.    That    was   at    the    battle    ofIdistaviso,[20] in the Valley of the Virgins.'     'If  I could speak with him,' the prisoner suddenly said musingly, 'I'msure he'd change sharply.'     'I don't suppose,' Pilate responded, 'that you'd bring  much joy to thelegate  of the  legion  if you decided to talk with any  of  his officers orsoldiers.  Anyhow, it's also not going to happen, fortunately for  everyone,and I will be the first to see to it.'     At that moment a  swallow swiftly flitted into the colonnade, describeda  circle under the golden ceiling, swooped down, almost brushed the face ofa bronze statue in a niche with its pointed wing, and disappeared behind thecapital of a column. It may be that it thought of nesting there.     During its flight, a formula took shape in the now light and lucid headof the procurator. It went  like this: the hegemon has looked into  the caseof  the vagrant  philosopher  Yeshua,  aliasHa-Nozri, and  found in  it  nogrounds  for indictment.  In  particular,  he  has  found  not the slightestconnection between the acts  of  Yeshua and  the disorders  that have latelytaken place in Yershalaim. The vagrant philosopher has proved to be mentallyill. Consequently, the procurator  has not confirmed  the  death sentence onHa-Nozri passed  by the Lesser  Sanhedrin. But  seeing  that Ha-Nozri's  madUtopian talk  might  cause disturbances  in  Yershalaim, the  procurator  isremoving  Yeshua  from Yershalaim  and  putting  him  under  confinement  inStratonian  Caesarea  on the Mediterranean  -  that is, precisely  where theprocurator's residence was.     It remained to dictate it to the secretary.     The  swallow's wings  whiffled  right over the hegemon's head, the birddarted to the fountain basin and then flew out into freedom.  The procuratorraised his eyes to the prisoner and saw the dust blaze up in a pillar aroundhim.     'Is that all about him?' Pilate asked the secretary.     'Unfortunately not,' the  secretary  replied  unexpectedly  and handedPilate another piece of parchment.     'What's this now?' Pilate asked and frowned.     Having  read what had  been handed to him, he changed  countenance evenmore:  Either  the  dark blood rose to his neck  and face, or something elsehappened,  only his skin  lost its  yellow tinge, turned brown, and his eyesseemed to sink.     Again  it  was probably owing to  the blood rising  to his  temples andthrobbing in them, only something happened to the procurator's vision. Thus,he imagined  that  the prisoner's  head floated off  somewhere,  and anotherappeared in its place.[21]  On this bald head sat a scant-pointedgolden diadem. On the forehead was a round canker, eating into the  skin andsmeared  with  ointment.  A  sunken,  toothless  mouth  with  a   pendulous,capricious  lower lip.  It seemed  to Pilate  that  the  pink columns of thebalcony  and the  rooftops  of  Yershalaim  far  below,  beyond  the garden,vanished,  and  everything  was  drowned  in  the thickest green  ofCapreangardens. And something strange also  happened to  his  hearing: it was as iftrumpets sounded  far  away,  muted and menacing, and a nasal voice was veryclearly heard, arrogandy drawling: 'The law of lese-majesty. . .'     Thoughts raced, short, incoherent and extraordinary: 'I'm lost! .  . .'then: 'We're lost! .  .  .' And among them a totally absurd one, about  someimmortality, which immortality for some reason provoked unendurable anguish.     Pilate strained,  drove  the  apparition away, his gaze returned to thebalcony, and again the prisoner's eyes were before him.     'Listen,  Ha-Nozri,'  the procurator spoke, looking  at  Yeshua somehowstrangely:  the procurator's face was  menacing, but his eyes  were alarmed,'did you ever say anything about the  great Caesar? Answer! Did you? .  .  .Yes ... or ... no?' Pilate drew  the word 'no' out  somewhat longer  than isdone in  court, and his glance sent Yeshua some thought that he wished as ifto instil in the prisoner.     To speak the truth is easyand pleasant,' the prisoner observed.     'I  have no need to know,' Pilate responded in a stifled, angry  voice,'whether it is pleasant or  unpleasant for you  to speak the truth. You willhave to speak it  anyway.  But, as you  speak, weigh  every word, unless youwant a not only inevitable but also painful death.'     No one  knew what  had happened  with the  procurator of Judea, but  heallowed  himself to raise his hand as  if to protect  himself from a ray  ofsunlight, and  from behind his hand, as from behind  a shield, to  send  theprisoner some sort of prompting look.     'Answer, then,' he went on speaking, 'do  you know a certain Judas fromKiriath,[22] and what precisely did you  say to him about Caesar,if you said anything?'     'It was  like this,'  the prisoner began  talking eagerly.  The eveningbefore  last, near the temple, I made  the acquaintance  of a young man  whocalled  himself Judas, from  the town of Kiriath. He invited me to his placein the Lower City and treated me to . . .'     'A goodman?' Pilate asked, and a devilish fire flashed in his eyes.     'A very  good man and an inquisitive  one,' the prisoner confirmed. 'Heshowed the greatest interest in my thoughts and  received me very cordially...'     'Lit the lamps . . .'[23] Pilate spoke through his teeth, inthe same tone as the prisoner, and his eyes glinted.     Tes,' Yeshua went on, slighdy surprised that the procurator was so wellinformed, 'and asked me to give my view of state authority. He was extremelyinterested in this question.'     'And what did  you say?' asked Pilate. 'Or are you going to reply  thatyou've  forgotten  what  you  said?' But  there was  already hopelessness inPilate's tone.     'Among  other  things,'  the  prisoner  recounted,  'I  said  that  allauthority is violence over people, and that a time will come when there willbe no authority of  die Caesars, nor any other authority. Man will pass intothe kingdom of truth and justice, where generally there will be no  need forany authority.'     'Go on!'     'I didn'tgo on,' said the  prisoner.  'Here men ran in,  bound me, andtook me away to prison.'     The secretary, trying not to let drop a single word, rapidly traced diewords on his parchment.     'There never has been, is not, and never  will be any authority in thisworld  greater or better  for  people  than the  authority  of  the  emperorTiberius!'  Pilate's  cracked and sick  voice swelled. For some  reason  dieprocurator looked at the secretary and the convoy with hatred.     'And  it is  not for  you, insane criminal, to  reason about it!'  HerePilate shouted: 'Convoy, off the balcony!' And turning to  the secretary, headded: 'Leave me alone widi the criminal, this is a state matter!'     The convoy raised dieir spears and with a measured  tramp  of hobnailedcaligae  walked off die balcony into the garden, and the  secretary followedthe convoy.     For some time the  silence on the balcony was broken  only by the watersinging  in  the fountain.  Pilate saw how  the watery dish blew up over thespout, how its edgesbroke off, how it fell down in streams.     The prisoner was the first to speak.     'I see that some misfortune has come about because  I  talked with thatyoung  man from  Kiriath. I have a foreboding, Hegemon, that he will come togrief, and I am very sorry for him.'     'I think,' the procurator replied, grinning strangely, 'that  there  isnow someone else in the world for whom  you ought to feel  sorrier than' forJudas  of Kiriath, and who is  going to have it much worse than Judas! . . .So, then. Mark Ratslayer, a cold and  convinced torturer, die people who, asI see,' the procurator pointed  to  Yeshua's disfigured face,  'beat you foryour  preaching,  the robbers  Dysmas  and Gestas, who widi  their confrereskilled four  soldiers, and, finally, the dirty traitor Judas -- are all goodpeople?'     'Yes,' said the prisoner.     'And the kingdom of truth will come?'     'It will, Hegemon,' Yeshua answered with conviction.     'It will  never come!'  Pilate suddenly cried out in  such  a  terriblevoice that Yeshuadrew  back.  Thus, many years before, in the Valley of theVirgins,  Pilate  had cried to  his horsemen the words: 'Cut them down!  Cutthem down! The giant Ratslayer  is trapped!'  He raised  his  voice, crackedwith commanding, still more, and called out so that his words could be heardin the garden: 'Criminal! Criminal! Criminal!' And dien, lowering his voice,he asked: 'Yeshua Ha-Nozri, do you believe in any gods?'     'God is one,' replied Yeshua, 'I believe in him.'     Then pray to him! Pray hard! However ...' here Pilate's voice gave out,'that won't help. No wife?' Pilate  asked with anguish for some reason,  notunderstanding what was happening to him. " 'No, I'm alone.'     'Hateful city . . .' die procurator suddenly muttered for some  reason,shaking his  shoulders as if  he  were cold, and rubbing his hands as thoughwashing them, 'if they'd put  a knife in you before your meeting with  Judasof Kiriath, it really would have been better.'     'Why  don't you let me go,  Hegemon?' the  prisoner asked unexpectedly,andhis voice became anxious. 'I see they want to kill me.'     A spasm  contorted  Pilate's face, he  turned  to Yeshua the  inflamed,red-veined whites of his eyes and said:     'Do  you  suppose, wretch, that the Roman  procurator will let a man gowho has said what you have said?  Oh, gods, gods! Or  do you think I'm readyto take your  place? I don't share your thoughts! And listen to  me: if fromthis moment on  you say even one word, if you speak to anyone at all, bewareof me! I repeat to you -- beware!'     'Hegemon . . .'     'Silence!' cried Pilate, and his furious gaze followed the swallow thathad again fluttered on to the balcony. 'To me!' Pilate shouted.     And when the secretary and the convoy returned to their  places, Pilateannounced that he confirmed the death sentence passed at the meeting of  theLesser Sanhedrin  on the criminal Yeshua  Ha-Nozri, and the  secretary wrotedown what Pilate said.     A  moment  later  Mark  Ratslayer  stood  before  the  procurator.  Theprocurator ordered him to  hand the criminal over to the head of the secretservice, along with the procurator's directive that Yeshua Ha-Nozri  was  tobe separated from the other condemned men, and also that the soldiers of thesecret service were  to be forbidden, on  pain of severe punishment, to talkwith Yeshua about anything at all or to answer any of his questions.     At a  sign  from Mark, the convoy closed around Yeshua and led him fromthe balcony.     Next  there stood before the  procurator a handsome, light-bearded  manwith eagle feathers on the crest of his helmet, golden  lions' heads shiningon his  chest,  and golden plaques on his  sword  belt, wearing triple-soledboots  laced  to the knees,  and with  a purple cloak  thrown  over his leftshoulder. This was the legate in command of the legion.     The procurator asked  him where  the Sebastean  cohort was stationed atthe  moment.  The legate told  him that the Sebasteans had cordoned  off thesquare in front of the hippodrome, where the sentencing of the criminals wasto be announcedto the people.     Then the procurator ordered the legate to detach two centuries from theRoman cohort. One of them, under the command of Ratslayer, was to convoy thecriminals,  the  carts  with  the  implements  for  the  execution  and  theexecutioners  as  they were transported to Bald Mountain,[24] andon arrival was to join the upper cordon. The other was to be sent at once toBald  Mountain and  immediately  start  forming  the  cordon.  For  the samepurpose, that is, to guard the mountain, the procurator asked the legate  tosend an auxiliary cavalry regiment -- the Syrian ala.     After the legate left the balcony, the procurator ordered the secretaryto summon to the palace the president of the Sanhedrin,  two of its members,and the head of the temple  guard in Yershalaim, adding that he asked thingsto be so arranged that  before conferring  with  all these people, he  couldspeak with the president previously and alone.     The procurator's order was executed quickly and precisely, and the sun,which  in  those  days  was  scorching  Yershalaim  with  an  extraordinaryfierceness, had not yet had time to approach its highest  point when, on theupper terrace of the garden, by the two white  marble lions that guarded thestairs, a meeting  took place between the  procurator and the man fulfillingthe duties  of  president  of the Sanhedrin,  the high  priest of the  Jews,Joseph Kaifa.[25]     It  was  quiet in the garden. But  when  he  came  out  from under  thecolonnade to the sun-drenched upper level  of the garden with its palm treeson monstrous elephant  legs, from which  there spread  before the procuratorthe whole of hateful Yershalaim, with its hanging bridges,  fortresses, and,above  all, that  utterly  indescribable heap  of marble with  golden dragonscales for  a  roof - the temple of Yershalaim - the procurator's  sharp earcaught, far below, where  the stone wall separated the lower terraces of thepalace  garden from  the  city square, a low rumble over which from  time totime there soared feeble, thin moansor cries.     The procurator understood that there, on the square, a numberless crowdof  Yershalaim  citizens,  agitated  by  the recent  disorders,  had alreadygathered, that this  crowd  was waiting impatiently  for the announcement ofthe sentences, and that restless water sellers were crying in its midst.     The procurator began by inviting the high priest on to  the balcony, totake shelter from the merciless heat,  but Kaifa politely apologized[26]and  explained  that he  could not do that  on the eve of  the feast.Pilate  covered  his  slightly  balding  head  with  a  hood and  began  theconversation. This conversation took place in Greek.     Pilate said  that  he had looked into  the case of  Yeshua Ha-Nozri andconfirmed the death sentence.     Thus, three robbers -  Dysmas, Gestas and Bar-Rabban  - and this YeshuaHa-Nozri besides,  were condemned to be executed, and it was to be done thatday. The  first two, who had ventured to  incite the people to rebel againstCaesar, had  been taken  in armed struggle by the  Roman authorities,  wereaccounted  to  the procurator, and, consequently,  would not be talked abouthere. But the second  two, Bar-Rabban and Ha-Nozri,  had been seized by  thelocal authorities  and  condemned by  the Sanhedrin. According  to the  law,according to custom, one of these two criminals had to be released in honourof  the  great feast  of  Passover, which would  begin that day. And so  theprocurator wished to know which  of the two criminals the Sanhedrin intendedto set free: Bar-Rabban or Ha-Nozri?[27]     Kaifa inclined  his head to signify that the question was clear to him,and replied:     'The  Sanhedrin asks that Bar-Rabban  be released.' The procurator knewvery  well that the high priest would  give precisely  that answer,  but histask consisted in showing that this answer provoked his astonishment.     This Pilate did with great artfulness.  The  eyebrows on  the  arrogantface rose,  the  procurator  looked  with amazement straight  into  the highpriest's eyes.     'I confess, this answerstuns  me,' the procurator  began softly,  'I'mafraid there may be some misunderstanding here.'     Pilate explained  himself. Roman  authority  does  not encroach in  theleast upon  the rights of the  local spiritual authorities,  the high priestknows  that very  well, but in the present case we are faced with an obviouserror.  And  this  error  Roman  authority  is,  of  course,  interested  incorrecting.     In fact, the crimes of Bar-Rabban and Ha-Nozri are  quite  incomparablein their  gravity. If the latter, obviously an  insane person,  is guilty ofuttering  preposterous  things in  Yershalaim  and  some other  places,  theformer's burden of guilt is more considerable. Not only did he allow himselfto  call  directly  for  rebellion, but  he also  killed a guard  during theattempt  to  arrest  him. Bar-Rabban  is  incomparably  more dangerous  thanHa-Nozri.     On  the strength of  all  the foregoing, the  procurator  asks the highpriest to reconsider the decision  and release the  less harmful of  the twocondemnedmen, and that is without doubt Ha-Nozri. And so? ...     Kaifa said in  a quiet but firm voice that the Sanhedrin had thoroughlyfamiliarized itself with the  case and informed him  a  second  time that itintended to free Bar-Rabban.     'What?  Even  after my intercession? The intercession  of  him  throughwhose person Roman authority speaks? Repeat it a third time. High Priest.'     'And a  third time I repeat that we are setting Bar-Rabban free,' Kaifasaid softly.     It was all over, and there was nothing more to talk about. Ha-Nozri wasdeparting  for ever, and there was no one to cure the dreadful, wicked painsof the procurator, there was no remedy for them except death. But it was notthis thought which now struck Pilate. The same incomprehensible anguish thathad already visited him on the balcony  pierced his whole being. He tried atonce to explain it, and the explanation was a strange one: it seemed vaguelyto the procurator that there was something he had not finished saying to thecondemned man, and perhapssomething he had not finished hearing.     Pilate drove this thought away, and it flew off as  instantly as it hadcome flying. It flew off, and the anguish remained unexplained, for it couldnot well be explained  by another brief thought that flashed like  lightningand at once went out -- 'Immortality . . . immortality has come . . .' Whoseimmortality  had come?  That  the  procurator  did not understand,  but  thethought of this enigmatic  immortality made  him grow cold in the  scorchingsun.     'Very well,' said Pilate, 'let it be so.'     Here  he turned,  gazed  around  at the  world visible to him, and  wassurprised  at the change that had taken place. The bush laden with roses hadvanished,  vanished were the cypresses bordering the upper terrace, and  thepomegranate tree, and the white statue amidst the greenery, and the greeneryitself.  In place of it  all there  floated some purple mass,[28]water weeds swayed  in it and began moving off somewhere, and Pilate himselfbegan moving  with them.  He was carriedalong now, smothered and burned, bythe most terrible wrath - the wrath of impotence.     'Cramped,' said Pilate, 'I feel cramped!'     With  a cold,  moist hand  he tore at the clasp  on  the  collar of hiscloak, and it fell to the sand.     'It's sultry  today, there's  a storm  somewhere,' Kaifa responded, nottaking his eyes  off the procurator's reddened face, and  foreseeing all thetorments  that still lay  ahead,  he  thought: 'Oh, what a terrible month ofNisan we're having this year!'     'No,' said Pilate, 'it's not  because of the sultriness, I feel crampedwith you here, Kaifa.' And, narrowing his eyes, Pilate smiled and added:     "Watch out for yourself. High Priest.'     The high  priest's dark eyes  glinted, and  with  his face  -  no  lessartfully than the procurator had done earlier -- he expressed amazement.     'What do I  hear. Procurator?' Kaifa  replied proudly and calmly.  "Youthreaten me after you yourself have confirmed  the sentence passed? Can thatbe? We are  accustomed to  theRoman procurator choosing his words before hesays something. What if we should be overheard, Hegemon?'     Pilate looked  at the high priest with dead eyes and, baring his teeth,produced a smile.     'What's your trouble. High Priest? Who can hear us where we are now? Doyou think I'm like that young vagrant holy fool who is to be executed today?Am I a boy, Kaifa? I know what I say and where I say it. There  is a  cordonaround the garden, a cordon around the palace, so that a  mouse couldn't getthrough any crack! Not only a mouse, but even that one, what's his name .  .. from the town of Kiriath, couldn't get through. Incidentally, High Priest,do you know him? Yes ...  if that one got  in here, he'd feel bitterly sorryfor himself, in this you will, of course,  believe me? Know, then, that fromnow on. High Priest, you  will have no peace! Neither you nor your people' -and Pilate pointed far off to  the right, where  the  temple blazed  on high-'it  is  I  who  tell you  so, Pontius  Pilate, equestrian  of  the  GoldenSpear!'[29]    'I know, I  know!' the  black-bearded Kaifa fearlessly replied, and hiseyes flashed. He raised his arm to heaven and  went  on: "The  Jewish peopleknow  that  you  hate them with  a cruel hatred, and  will  cause  them muchsuffering,  but you will not destroy them utterly! God will protect them! Hewill hear us, the almighty Caesar will  hear, he will protect us from Pilatethe destroyer!'     'Oh, no!' Pilate exclaimed, and  he felt lighter and lighter with everyword: there was no more need to pretend,  no more  need to choose his words,"fou have complained about me too much to Caesar, and  now my hour has come,Kaifa! Now the message will fly from me, and not to the governor in Antioch,and  not to  Rome,  but directly  to Capreae, to  the  emperor  himself, themessage of how you in Yershalaim  are sheltering known criminals from death.And then it will not be water from  Solomon's Pool that I give Yershalaim todrink, as I wanted to do for  your own good! No, not water!  Remember how onaccount of you I hadto  remove the shields with the emperor's insignia fromthe  walls, had to  transfer  troops, had, as you see, to come  in person tolook into what goes on with you here! Remember my words: it is  not just onecohort that you will see here in Yershalaim,  High Priest  -  no! The  wholeFulminata legion will come under the city  walls,  the Arabian  cavalry willarrive, and then you will hear bitter weeping and wailing! You will rememberBar-Rabban then, whom  you saved, and  you will  regret having  sent  to hisdeath a philosopher with his peaceful preaching!'     The high priest's face became  covered  with blotches, his eyes burned.Like the procurator, he smiled, baring his teeth, and replied:     'Do  you yourself believe what you are saying now. Procurator?  No, youdo  not!  It is  not peace, not  peace,  that  the  seducer of the people ofYershalaim  brought us, and you, equestrian, understand that perfectly well.You wanted to  release him so  that he could disturb the people, outrage thefaith, and  bring the peopleunder  Roman swords! But I, the high  priest ofthe  Jews,  as long  as I live, will not allow the faith to be outraged  andwill  protect  the people! Do  you hear,  Pilate?' And  Kaifa raised his armmenacingly: 'Listen, Procurator!'     Kaifa fell silent, and the procurator again  heard a noise as if of thesea, rolling up to  the very  walls of the garden  of  Herod  the Great. Thenoise rose  from below to the feet  and into the face of the procurator. Andbehind  his back,  there, beyond  the  wings of  the palace,  came  alarmingtrumpet calls, the  heavy crunch of  hundreds of feet, the clanking of iron.The  procurator understood that the Roman infantry  was already setting out,on  his orders,  speeding to the parade of death so terrible for  rebels androbbers.     'Do  you hear.  Procurator?' the high priest repeated quietly. 'Are yougoing to tell me that all this' - here the high priest raised  both arms andthe dark hood  fell from his head - 'has been caused by the wretched  robberBar-Rabban?'     The procuratorwiped his  wet, cold forehead with the back of his hand,looked at the ground, then, squinting at the sky, saw  that the red-hot ballwas almost over his head and that Kaifa's  shadow  had shrunk to  nothing bvthe lion's tail, and said quietly and indifferently:     'It's nearly noon.  We got carried away by our conversation, and yet wemust proceed.'     Having apologized in refined terms  before  the high priest, he invitedhim to sit down on a  bench in  the shade  of  a magnolia and  wait until hesummoned the other persons needed for the last brief conference and gave onemore instruction connected with the execution.     Kaifa bowed  politely, placing his hand on  his heart,  and stayed irirthe  garden  while  Pilate  returned  to  the  balcony. There  he  told  thesecretary, who had been  waiting for him, to invite to the garden the legateof the legion and the  tribune of the cohort,  as well as the two members ofthe  Sanhedrin and the  head  of the temple guard, who had been awaiting hissummons on the lower gardenterrace,  in a round gazebo with a  fountain. Tothis Pilate added that he himself would come out to the  garden at once, andwithdrew into the palace.     While  the secretary was gathering the conference, the procurator  met,in a room shielded  from the sun by dark curtains, with a certain man, whoseface was half covered  by a hood, though he could not have been  bothered bythe  sun's  rays in  this  room.  The  meeting was a  very  short  one.  Theprocurator quietly spoke a few words to the man, after which he withdrew andPilate walked out through the colonnade to the garden.     There,  in  the  presence  of  all  those he  had desired to  see,  theprocurator solemnly and drily stated that he confirmed the death sentence on Yeshua Ha-Nozri, and officially inquired  of the members of the Sanhedrin asto  whom among  the criminals they would like to grant life. Having receivedthe reply that it was Bar-Rabban, the procurator said:     Very well,' and told the  secretary to put it into the record at  once,clutched in  his hand  the clasp that the secretary had picked up from  thesand, and said solemnly: Tt is time!'     Here  all those present started down  the wide marble stairway  betweenwalls of  roses that exuded  a  stupefying aroma, descending lower and lowertowards the palace wall, to the gates opening  on to the big, smoothly pavedsquare,  at the end  of  which could be seen the columns and statues  of theYershalaim stadium.     As soon as the group entered the square from the garden and mounted thespacious stone platform that dominated the  square, Pilate,  looking  aroundthrough narrowed eyelids, assessed the situation.     The  space  he  had just traversed, that is, the space  from the palacewall to the platform,  was empty, but before him Pilate could no longer  seethe square - it had been swallowed up  by the crowd, which would have pouredover the platform and the cleared space as well, had it not been kept at bayby a triple  row of Sebastean soldiers to the left of Pilate and soldiers ofthe auxiliary Itureancohort to his right.     And so, Pilate mounted the platform, mechanically clutching the uselessclasp in his fist and squinting  his eyes.  The procurator was squinting notbecause the sun burned  his eyes -- no! For some  reason  he did not want tosee the group  of  condemned  men who,  as he knew perfectly well, were  nowbeing brought on to the platform behind him.     As soon as the white cloak with crimson lining appeared  high up on thestone cliff over the verge of the human sea, the unseeing  Pilate was struckin the ears bv a wave of  sound:  'Ha-a-a . . .' It started mutedly, arisingsomewhere  far away  by the hippodrome,  then  became thunderous and, havingheld out  for  a few  seconds, began  to  subside.  They've  seen  me,'  theprocurator  thought. The  wave  had  not reached its  lowest point before itstarted  swelling  again  unexpectedly  and, swaying, rose higher  than  thefirst, and as foam boils up on the billows of the sea, so a whistling boiledup on this second wave and, separate, distinguishablefrom the  thunder, thewails  of women. They've been led on to the platform,' thought Pilate,  'andthe wails mean that several women got crushed as the crowd surged forward.'     He waited for some  time, knowing that no power could silence the crowdbefore it exhaled all that was pent up in it and fell silent of itself.     And when this moment  came, the procurator threw up his  right arm, andthe last noise was blown away from the crowd.     Then Pilate drew into his breast as much of the hot air as he could andshouted, and his cracked voice carried over thousands of heads:     'In the name of the emperor Caesar! . . .'     Here  his ears were struck several times by  a  clipped iron shout: thecohorts of soldiers  raised high their spears and standards and shouted  outterribly:     'Long live Caesar!'     Pilate lifted  his face and thrust it straight into the sun. Green fireflared  up behind his  eyelids,  his brain took  flame from  it,  and hoarseAramaic words went flying over the crowd:     'Four  criminals, arrested  in Yershalaim  for murder,  incitement  torebellion, and  outrages against the laws and the faith, have been sentencedto a  shameful  execution  -  by hanging on posts! And  this  execution willpresently be carried out on  Bald Mountain! The  names of  the criminals areDysmas, Gestas, Bar-Rabban and Ha-Nozri. Here they stand before you!'     Pilate pointed to his right, not seeing any criminals, but knowing theywere there, in place, where they ought to be.     The  crowd responded with a  long rumble as if of surprise  or  relief.When it died down, Pilate continued:     'But only three  of them will be executed, for, in accordance with  lawand custom, in honour of the feast of Passover, to  one of the condemned, aschosen  by  the  Lesser Sanhedrin  and  confirmed  by  Roman authority,  themagnanimous emperor Caesar will return his contemptible life!'     Pilate cried out the words and at the same time listened as the  rumblewas replaced by a great silence. Not a sigh, not  a  rustle reached his earsnow,and there was even a moment  when  it  seemed to Pilate that everythingaround  him had vanished altogether. The hated  city died,  and  he alone isstanding there, scorched  by the sheer  rays,  his face set against the sky.Pilate held the silence a little longer, and then began to cry out:     'The name of  the one who will now be set free before  you is . . .' Hemade one more pause, holding back the name, making  sure  he  had  said all,because  he knew that the dead  city would  resurrect  once the name  of thelucky  man  was spoken, and  no further  words would be heard. 'All?' Pilatewhispered soundlessly to himself.  'All. The  name!' And, rolling the letter'r' over the silent city, he cried:     'Bar-Rabban!'     Here it  seemed  to  him that the sun,  clanging,  burst  over  him andflooded his ears  with  fire.  This fire raged  with  roars, shrieks, wails,guffaws and whistles.     Pilate  turned  and walked  back across the  platform  to  the  stairs,looking at nothing  except the multicoloured  squaresof the flooring  underhis feet, so as not to trip.  He knew that behind his back  the platform wasbeing showered with bronze coins, dates, that people in the howling mob wereclimbing on shoulders,  crushing  each  other, to see the miracle with theirown eyes - how a man already in the grip of death escaped that grip! How thelegionaries take the ropes off him, involuntarily causing  him  burning painin  his  arms, dislocated during  his  interrogation;  how  he, wincing  andgroaning, nevertheless smiles a senseless, crazed smile.     He knew that at the same time the convoy was already leading the  threemen with bound arms to the side stairs, so as to take them to the road goingwest  from  the  city,  towards  Bald  Mountain.  Only  when he was  off theplatform, to the rear of  it, did Pilate open his eyes, knowing  that he wasnow safe -- he could no longer see the condemned men.     Mingled with the wails of the quieting crowd,  yet distinguishable fromthem, were the piercing cries of heralds repeating,  some inAramaic, othersin Greek,  all that  the procurator had cried out from the platform. Besidesthat, there came to his ears the tapping, clattering and approaching thud ofhoofs,  and  a trumpet calling  out something brief and merry. These  soundswere  answered by the drilling whistles of bovs on the roofs of houses alongthe street that led from the bazaar to  the hippodrome  square, and by criesof 'Look out!'     A soldier,  standing alone in the cleared space of  the  square  with astandard  in his hand,  waved it anxiously,  and  then  the  procurator, thelegate of the legion, the secretary and the convoy stopped.     A cavalry  ala, at an ever-lengthening  trot, flew out into the square,so as to cross it at one side, bypassing the mass of people, and ride down alane under a stone  wall  covered with  creeping vines, taking the  shortestroute to Bald Mountain.     At a  flying trot, small as a boy, dark as a mulatto, the commander  ofthe ala, a Syrian,  coming abreast  of Pilate,  shouted something in a  highvoiceand snatched his sword  from  its  sheath. The  angry, sweating  blackhorse  shied and reared.  Thrusting his sword  back  into  its  sheath,  thecommander struck the horse's  neck with his crop, brought him down, and rodeoff  into  the lane, breaking  into a gallop.  After him,  three  by  three,horsemen flew in  a cloud  of  dust, the  tips  of their light bamboo lancesbobbing,  and faces dashed past  the procurator - looking especially swarthyunder their white turbans - with merrily bared, gleaming teeth.     Raising dust to  the sky, the ala  burst into the lane, and the last toride past Pilate  was a soldier with a trumpet slung on his back, blazing inthe sun.     Shielding himself from the dust with his hand  and  wrinkling his  facediscontentedly,  Pilate started  on in  the  direction  of  the gates to thepalace garden, and after him came the legate, the secretary, and the convoy.     It was around ten o'clock in the morning.
CHAPTER 3. The Seventh Proof       'Yes,  it was  around  ten  o'clock in  the morning, my  esteemed  IvanNikolaevich,' said the professor.     The poet passed his  hand over his face like a man  just coming to  hissenses, and saw that it  was  evening at the Patriarch's Ponds. The water inthe pond had turned black, and a light boat was  now gliding on it,  and onecould hear  the splash of oars  and the  giggles of some  citizeness  in thelittle  boat. The public appeared on the benches  along the walks, but againon  the other  three  sides  of  the square,  and not on the side where  ourinterlocutors were.     The sky over Moscow seemed to lose colour, and the  full moon could  beseen  quite  distinctly high above,  not yet  golden but white. It  was mucheasier  to breathe,  and the voices  under the lindens  now sounded  softer,eveningish.     'How  is it I didn't notice that he'd  managed to spin a whole story? ...'  Homeless thought in amazement. 'It's already evening!  ... Or maybe  hewasn't telling it, but I simply fell asleep anddreamed it all?'     But  it must be supposed that the  professor  did tell  the story afterall, otherwise it  would  have to be assumed that  Berlioz had had  the samedream, because he said, studying the foreigner's face attentively:     'Your story is  extremely  interesting,  Professor,  though it does notcoincide at all with the Gospel stories.'     'Good heavens,'  the professor responded, smiling condescendingly, 'youof all people  should know that precisely nothing of  what is written in theGospels ever  actually took place,  and if we start referring to the Gospelsas  a historical  source  .  .  .' he  smiled once more, and Berlioz stoppedshort, because  this was  literally the same thing  he  had been  saying  toHomeless as they walked down Bronnaya towards the Patriarch's Ponds.     'That's so,' Berlioz replied, 'but I'm afraid no one can  confirm  thatwhat you've just told us actually took place either.'     'Oh, yes! That there is one who can!' the professor, beginning to speakin  broken  language, said  with  great  assurance,  and   with  unexpectedmysteriousness he motioned the two friends to move closer.     They leaned towards him from both sides, and he said, but again withoutany accent, which with him, devil knows why, now appeared, now disappeared:     The thing is . ..' here the professor looked around fearfully and spokein a  whisper, 'that  I was personally present at  it  all. I was on PontiusPilate's balcony, and in the  garden when  he talked  with Kaifa, and on theplatform,  only  secredy, incognito, so to speak,  and therefore I beg you -not a word to anyone, total secrecy, shh . . .'     Silence fell, and Berlioz paled.     'YOU ..  . how long have you been in  Moscow?' he asked in a  quaveringvoice.     'I just  arrived  in  Moscow  this  very  minute,' the  professor  saidperplexedly, and only here  did it occur to the friends to take a  good lookin  his eyes, at which they  became  convinced that his left  eye, the greenone, was totally insane, while the right one was empty, black anddead.     'There's   the  whole   explanation  for  you!'  Berlioz   thought   inbewilderment. 'A mad German has turned up, or  just went crazy at the Ponds.What a story!'     Yes, indeed, that explained the whole thing: the most strange breakfastwith  the  late philosopher Kant, the foolish talk about  sunflower  oil andAnnushka, the  predictions about his  head being cut off and all the rest  -the professor was mad.     Berlioz  realized  at once  what had  to  be done. Leaning  back on thebench, he winked  to  Homeless behind the professor's back -  meaning, don'tcontradict him - but the perplexed poet did not understand these signals.     'Yes,  yes,  yes,'  Berlioz  said  excitedly,  'incidentally  it's  allpossible . . . even very  possible, Pontius Pilate, and the balcony,  and soforth . . . Did you come alone or with your wife?'     'Alone, alone, I'm always alone,' the professor replied bitterly.     'And where  are  your things, Professor?'  Berlioz asked insinuatingly.'At the Metropol?* Where are youstaying?'     'I? ...  Nowhere,'  the  half-witted  German  answered, his  green  eyewandering in wild anguish over the Patriarch's Ponds.     'How's that? But .. .  where are you going to live?'     'In your apartment,' the madman suddenly said brashly, and winked.     'I ... I'm  very  glad ...' Berlioz began  muttering, 'but, really, youwon't be comfortable at my place  ...  and they have  wonderful rooms at theMetropol, it's a first-class hotel...'     'And there's no  devil either?' the sick man  suddenly inquired merrilyof Ivan Nikolaevich.     'No devil. . .'     'Don't contradict him,' Berlioz whispered with his  lips only, droppingbehind the professor's back and making faces.     There isn't  any  devil!' Ivan Nikolaevich,  at a loss  from  all  thisbalderdash, cried out  not what he ought.  'What a punishment!  Stop playingthe psycho!'     Here the insane man burst into such laughter that a sparrow flew out ofthe linden over the seated men's heads.     'Well, now that is positively interesting!' the professorsaid, shakingwith  laughter. 'What is it  with you -  no matter what one asks for,  thereisn't  any!' He suddenly stopped  laughing  and, quite understandably for  amentally ill person,  fell into the opposite extreme after  laughing, becamevexed and cried sternly: 'So you mean there just simply isn't any?'     'Calm down, calm  down, calm  down. Professor,'  Berlioz  muttered, forfear of  agitating the  sick  man.  'You sit here for a  little minute  withComrade Homeless,  and I'll just run to the comer to  make a phone call, andthen we'll take you wherever you like. You don't know the city . . .'     Berlioz's plan must be  acknowledged as correct:  he had  to run to thenearest public  telephone  and  inform the  foreigners' bureau, thus and so,there's some consultant  from abroad sitting at  the Patriarch's Ponds in anobviously abnormal  state. So it was  necessary  to take measures, lest someunpleasant nonsense result.     To make a call? Well, then make your call,' the sick man  agreed sadly,and suddenly begged passionately: 'But  I  implore  you, before you go,  atleast believe that the devil exists! I no  longer ask you for anything more.Mind you, there exists a seventh proof of  it,  the surest of all! And it isgoing to be presented to you right now!'     'Very good, very good,' Berlioz said with false tenderness and, winkingto  the upset poet, who  did  not relish at all the idea of guarding the madGerman, set out for  the exit from the Ponds at the  comer  of  Bronnaya andYermolaevsky Lane.     And the professor seemed to recover his health and brighten up at once.     'Mikhail Alexandrovich!' he shouted after Berlioz.      The  latter gave  a start, looked back, but reassured  himself with thethought that  the  professor had also  learned his name and patronymic  fromsome newspaper.     Then the professor called out, cupping his hands like a megaphone:     'Would  you  like  me to have  a telegram sent at once to your uncle inKiev?'     And again Berlioz winced. How does  the madman know about the existenceof  a Kievan  uncle?  That  has  certainly  never  been  mentioned  in  anynewspapers. Oh-oh, maybe Homeless is right after all? And suppose his papersare  phoney?  Ah,  what a  strange  specimen ...  Call, call! Call  at once!They'll quickly explain him!     And, no longer listening to anything, Berlioz ran on.     Here, just at the exit to Bronnaya, there rose from a bench to meet theeditor exactly the  same citizen  who in  the  sunlight  earlier had  formedhimself out of the thick swelter. Only now he was no longer made of air, butordinary,  fleshly,  and Berlioz  clearly  distinguished  in  the  beginningtwilight that he  had  a little moustache like  chicken feathers, tiny eyes,ironic and half drunk, and  checkered trousers pulled  up so  high that  hisdirty white socks showed.     Mikhail Alexandrovich  drew back,  but reassured himself  by reflectingthat it  was  a stupid coincidence and that generally  there was no  time tothink about it now.     'Looking for the turnstile,  citizen?' the checkered type inquiredin acracked  tenor. This way,  please! Straight on and  you'll  get where you'regoing. How  about  a little  pint pot  for my  information ...  to set up anex-choirmaster! . ..' Mugging, the specimen swept his jockey's cap from  hishead.     Berlioz,  not  stopping  to   listen   to   the  cadging  and  clowningchoir-master,  ran up to the turnstile and took hold of it with his hand. Heturned it and was just about  to step across  the  rails when  red and whitelight  splashed  in  his face.  A  sign  lit up  in  a  glass box:  'CautionTram-Car!'     And right then this tram-car came racing along, turning down the  newlylaid line  from Yermolaevsky to Bronnaya. Having  turned,  and coming to thestraight stretch, it suddenly  lit  up inside  with electricity, whined, andput on speed.     The prudent Berlioz, though he was standing in a safe place, decided toretreat behind the stile, moved his hand on  the crossbar, and stepped back.And right then his hand slipped and slid, one foot, unimpeded, as if on ice,went downthe cobbled slope leading to the rails, the other  was thrust intothe air, and Berlioz was thrown on to the rails.     Trying to get hold of  something, Berlioz  fell backwards, the back  ofhis head  lightly striking the cobbles, and had time  to see high up --  butwhether to right or  left he  no  longer knew --  the  gold-tinged moon.  Hemanaged  to turn on his  side, at  the same moment drawing his  legs  to hisstomach  in  a frenzied movement, and, while turning, to make out the  face,completely white with horror, and the  crimson armband  of the  woman driverbearing down on him  with irresistible  force. Berlioz did not cry  out, butaround him the whole street screamed with desperate female voices.     The woman driver tore at the  electric brake, the car dug its nose intothe ground, then instantly jumped up, and glass flew from the windows with acrash and a jingle. Here someone in Berlioz's brain cried  desperately: 'Canit be? . ..' Once more, and for  the  last time, the  moon  flashed, but nowbreaking topieces, and then it became dark.     The tram-car went over Berlioz, and  a round dark object was  thrown upthe  cobbled  slope below the fence  of the Patriarch's walk.  Having rolledback down this slope, it went bouncing along the cobblestones of the street.     It was the severed head of Berlioz.
CHAPTER 4. The Chase       The hysterical women's cries  died  down, the police  whistles  stoppeddrilling, two ambulances drove off -- one with the headless body and severedhead, to the morgue, the other  with the beautiful driver, wounded by brokenglass; street sweepers in  white  aprons removed the broken glass and pouredsand on the pools of blood, but Ivan Nikolaevich just stayed on the bench ashe had dropped on  to  it before reaching the turnstile.  He  tried  severaltimes to get  up,  but  his  legs would not  obey him  -- something akin  toparalysis had occurred with Homeless.     The  poet  had  rushed to the  turnstile as soon  as he heard the firstscream, and had seen the head go  bouncing along the  pavement. With that heso lost his  senses that, having  dropped on  to the  bench, he bit his handuntil it bled. Of course, he forgot about the mad German and tried to figureout one  thing only:  how it  could be that he  had just  been  talking withBerlioz, and a moment later - the head . . .     Agitated  people wentrunning down the  walk past  the poet, exclaimingsomething, but Ivan Nikolaevich was  insensible to their words. However, twowomen  unexpectedly  ran  into  each  other  near  him,  and  one  of  them,sharp-nosed and bare-headed, shouted the following to the other,  right nextto the poet's ear:     '.  . . Annushka, our Annushka! From Sadovaya! It's her work .  . . Shebought  sunflower  oil  at  the  grocery,  and  went  and  broke  the  wholelitre-bottle on the turnstile! Messed her skirt all up, and swore and swore!.. . And he, poor man, must have slipped and - right on to the rails . ..'     Of  all  that  the  woman  shouted,  one  word lodged  itself  in  IvanNikolaevich's upset brain: 'Annushka'. ..     'Annushka . . . Annushka?' the poet muttered, looking around anxiously.Wait a minute, wait a minute . . .'     The word 'Annushka' got strung together with the words 'sunflower oil',and then for some reason with 'Pondus Pilate'. The poet dismissed Pilate andbegan Unking up the  chain that started from theword  'Annushka'. And  thischain got very quickly linked up and led at once to the mad professor.     'Excuse  me!  But he  did  say the meeting wouldn't take  place becauseAnnushka  had spilled the oil.  And,  if you please,  it won't  take  place!What's more, he said straight out that  Berlioz's head would be cut off by awoman?! Yes, yes, yes! And the driver was a woman! What is all this, eh?!'     There was not a grain of doubt left that the mysterious consultant  hadknown  beforehand the  exact  picture of the terrible death of Berlioz. Heretwo  thoughts  pierced the  poet's brain.  The first: 'He's not mad  in  theleast,  that's all  nonsense!' And the  second: Then didn't he set it all uphimself?'     'But in  what manner, may we  ask?!  Ah, no,  this we're  going to findout!'     Making  a  great  effort, Ivan Nikolaevich  got up from the  bench  andrushed  back  to  where  he  had  been  talking  with  the  professor.  And,fortunately, it turned out that the man had not left yet.     The street lights were already lit on Bronnaya, and over the Ponds thegolden moon shone, and in the ever-deceptive  light of the moon it seemed toIvan Nikolaevich that he  stood holding a sword, not a  walking stick, underhis arm.     The ex-choirmaster was sitting in the very place where Ivan Nikolaevichhad sat just recently. Now the busybody had perched on his nose an obviouslyunnecessary pince-nez, in  which  one  lens was missing  altogether and  theother was cracked. This  made the checkered citizen even more repulsive thanhe had been when he showed Berlioz the way to the rails.     With a chill in his heart, Ivan approached the professor  and, glancinginto  his face,  became convinced that there were not and never had been anysigns of madness in that face.     'Confess, who are you?' Ivan asked in a hollow voice.     The foreigner  scowled, looked at the poet as if he were seeing him forthe first time, and answered inimically:     'No understand ... no speak Russian. ..'     The gent don't understand,' the  choirmaster mixed infrom  the  bench,though no one had asked him to explain the foreigner's words.     'Don't pretend!' Ivan said threateningly, and  felt cold in  the pit ofhis stomach. 'You spoke excellent Russian just now. You're not a  German andyou're not a professor! You're a murderer and a spy!  ... Your papers!' Ivancried fiercely.     The mysterious  professor  squeamishly  twisted his  mouth,  which  wastwisted to begin with, then shrugged his shoulders.     'Citizen!'  the  loathsome  choirmaster  butted in again. "What're  youdoing bothering a foreign tourist? For that you'll incur severe punishment!'     And the suspicious professor made  an arrogant face, turned, and walkedaway from  Ivan. Ivan felt himself  at a  loss. Breathless, he addressed thechoirmaster:     'Hey, citizen, help me to detain the criminal! It's your duty!'     The  choirmaster   became  extraordinarily  animated,  jumped   up  andhollered:     'What  criminal?  Where is he?  A foreign criminal?' The  choirmaster'seyes sparkled gleefully. Thatone? If he's a criminal, the first thing to dois shout "Help!" Or  else he'll get away. Come on, together  now, one, two!'-- and here the choirmaster opened his maw.     Totally  at a  loss, Ivan  obeyed the trickster and shouted 'Help!' butthe choirmaster bluffed him and did not shout anything.     Ivan's solitary, hoarse cry did not produce any good results. Two girlsshied away from him, and he heard the word 'drunk'.     'Ah, so you're in with him!' Ivan  cried out, waxing  wroth.  "What areyou doing, jeering at me? Out of my way!'     Ivan  dashed  to  the right, and so did the choirmaster; Ivan dashed tothe left, and the scoundrel did the same.     'Getting  under  my feet  on purpose?'  Ivan  cried, turning ferocious. 'I'll hand you over to the police!'     Ivan attempted  to grab  the blackguard  by the sleeve,  but missed andcaught precisely nothing: it  was  as  if the  choirmaster  fell through theearth.     Ivan gasped, looked into the distance, and saw the hateful stranger. Hewas alreadyat the exit to Patriarch's Lane; moreover, he was not alone. Themore than dubious choirmaster had  managed to join  him. But  that was stillnot all: the third in this company proved  to be a tom-cat, who appeared outof nowhere, huge as a hog, black as soot or  as a rook, and with a desperatecavalryman's  whiskers.  The trio  set  off down  Patriarch's Lane,  the catwalking on his hind legs.     Ivan  sped after  the  villains  and became convinced at once that it -would be very difficult to catch up with them.     The  trio  shot  down  the  lane  in  an  instant   and  came   out  onSpiri-donovka. No  matter how Ivan quickened his pace,  the distance betweenhim  and his  quarry  never  diminished.  And  before the poet  knew  it, heemerged, after the quiet of Spiridonovka, by  the  Nikitsky Gate,  where hissituation worsened. The place was swarming with people. Besides, the gang ofvillains decided to apply the favourite  trick of  bandits here: a scatteredgetaway.     The choirmaster,  with great  dexterity, bored  his  way  on  to a busspeeding towards the Arbat Square and slipped  away. Having lost  one of hisquarry, Ivan focused his attention on the cat and saw this strange cat go upto the footboard  of an 'A' tram waiting at a stop, brazenly elbow  aside  awoman, who screamed, grab hold of the handrail, and even make an  attempt toshove  a ten-kopeck  piece into the conductress's hand through  the  window,open on account of the stuffiness.     Ivan was so struck by the cat's  behaviour that he froze motionless  bythe  grocery store on the corner, and here he was struck for a second  time,but much  more strongly, by the conductress's behaviour. As  soon as she sawthe cat getting into the tram-car, she shouted with a  malice that even madeher shake:     'No cats allowed! Nobody with cats allowed! Scat! Get off, or I'll callthe police!'     Neither the conductress nor  the passengers were struck by the  essenceof the matter: not just that a cat was boarding a tram-car, which would havebeen good enough, but that hewas going to pay!     The cat turned out  to be  not only  a solvent  but also  a disciplinedanimal. At the very first shout from the conductress, he halted his advance,got off  the footboard, and sat down at the stop, rubbing his whiskers  withthe ten-kopeck piece. But as soon as the conductress yanked the cord and thetram-car started moving off, the cat acted like anyone who has been expelledfrom a tram-car but sail needs a ride. Letting all three cars go by, the catjumped on to the rear coupling-pin of the last one, wrapped its paws  aroundsome hose sticking out of  the side, and rode off,  thus  saving himself tenkopecks.     Occupied with  the obnoxious  cat, Ivan almost lost the main one of thethree -- the professor.  But, fortunately, the man had not managed  to  slipaway. Ivan saw the  grey  beret  in  the  throng  at  the  head  of BolshayaNikitskaya, now Herzen,  Street. In the  twinkling of an  eye,  Ivan arrivedthere  himself. However, he  had no luck.  The poet would quicken  his pace,break into atrot, shove  passers-by,  yet  not  get an inch closer  to  theprofessor.     Upset as he was, Ivan was still struck by the supernatural speed of thechase. Twenty seconds had not gone by  when,  after the  Nikitsky Gate, IvanNikolaevich was  already  dazzled by the lights of the Arbat Square. Anotherfew seconds, and here was some dark lane with slanting sidewalks, where IvanNikolaevich  took a tumble and hurt his knee. Again a lit-up  thoroughfare -Kropotkin Street - then a lane, then Ostozhenka, then another  lane, dismal,vile and sparsely lit.  And  it was here that  Ivan Nikolaevich definitivelylost him whom he needed so much. The professor disappeared.     Ivan Nikolaevich was  perplexed,  but not for long, because he suddenlyrealized that the professor must unfailingly be  found in house  no. 15, andmost assuredly in apartment 47.     Bursting  into  the  entrance, Ivan  Nikolaevich flew up to the  secondfloor, immediately found the  apartment,  and rang impatiently.  He did  nothave to wait  long. Some littlegirl of about five opened the  door for Ivanand, without asking him anything, immediately went away somewhere.     In  the huge, extremely neglected front  hall, weakly  lit  by  a  tinycarbon arc lamp  under the high ceiling, black with grime, a bicycle withouttyres hung on the wall, a huge iron-bound trunk stood, and  on  a shelf overthe coat rack a winter hat  lay, its long ear-flaps hanging down. Behind oneof  the doors, a resonant male voice was angrily shouting something in versefrom a radio set.     Ivan  Nikolaevich  was  not  the least at  a  loss  in  the  unfamiliarsurroundings  and rushed  straight  into  the corridor, reasoning  thus: 'Ofcourse,  he's hiding in the bathroom.' The corridor was  dark. Having bumpedinto the wall  a few times, Ivan saw  a faint streak of light under a  door,felt for the handle,  and pulled  it  gendy.  The  hook popped out, and Ivanfound himself precisely in the bathroom and thought how lucky he was.     However, his luck was not all it might have been! Ivan met  witha waveof humid heat and, by the light of the coals smouldering in the boiler, madeout  big  basins  hanging  on the walls, and a bath tub, all black frightfulblotches where  the enamel  had  chipped off. And there,  in  this bath tub,stood a naked  cidzeness,  all soapy  and  with  a scrubber in her hand. Shesquinted near-sightedly at the bursting-in Ivan and, obviously mistaking himin the infernal light, said sofdy and gaily:     'Kiriushka! Stop this  tomfoolery! Have you lost your mind? .. . FyodorIvanych will be back any minute. Get out  right now!' and  she waved at Ivanwith the scrubber.     The  misunderstanding was evident, and Ivan Nikolaevich was, of course,to  blame  for  it.  But  he  did  not  want  to admit  it  and,  exclaimingreproachfully: 'Ah,  wanton creature! ...', at once  found himself for  somereason  in  the  kitchen.  No  one  was  there,  and  on  the  oven  in  thesemi-darkness silently stood about  a dozen extinguished primuses.' A singlemoonbeam,  having  seeped through  the  dusty, perennially unwashed window,shone sparsely  into the corner where, in dust and cobwebs, a forgotten iconhung,  with the ends  of two wedding candles[2 ]peeking out  frombehind its casing.  Under the big icon, pinned to it, hung a little one madeof paper.     No one  knows what thought took hold of  Ivan  here, but before runningout the  back door, he appropriated  one of these  candles,  as well as  thepaper icon.  With  these objects, he  left the unknown  apartment, mutteringsomething, embarrassed at the thought of what he had just experienced in thebathroom, involuntarily trying to guess who this impudent Kiriushka might beand whether the disgusting hat with ear-flaps belonged to him.     In the desolate, joyless lane the poet looked around, searching for thefugitive, but he was nowhere to be seen. Then Ivan said firmly to himself:     'Why, of course, he's at the Moscow River! Onward!'     Someone ought, perhaps, to have  asked Ivan Nikolaevich why he supposedthat the professor was precisely at the  MoscowRiver  and not in some otherplace. But the trouble was that there was no one to ask  him.  The loathsomelane was completely empty.     In  the  very shortest time, Ivan  Nikolaevich could  be  seen  on  thegranite steps of the Moscow River amphitheatre.[3]     Having  taken off his  clothes,  Ivan  entrusted  them  to  a pleasant,bearded fellow  who  was smoking a hand-rolled cigarette, sitting  beside  atorn white Tolstoy blouse and a pair  of unlaced,  worn boots.  After wavinghis arms to cool off, Ivan dived swallow-fashion into the water.     It took his breath away, so  cold the water  was,  and the thought evenflashed in him  that he might not manage to come up to the surface. However,he did manage to come  up, and, puffing  and  snorting, his eyes  rounded interror,  Ivan  Nikolaevich began  swimming  through the  black, oil-smellingwater among the broken zigzags of street lights on the bank.     When the wet Ivan came dancing back up the steps to the place where thebearded fellow was guarding his clothes, it became clear that not  only thelatter, but also the former - that is, the bearded fellow himself - had beenstolen.  In  the exact spot where the  pile of clothes  had been, a  pair ofstriped drawers, the torn Tolstoy blouse, the candle, the icon and a  box ofmatches had  been left. After  threatening someone in the  distance with hisfist in powerless anger, Ivan put on what was left for him.     Here two  considerations began to trouble him: first, that his Massolitidentification  card,  which he never parted with, was  gone,  and,  second,whether he could  manage to get through Moscow unhindered looking the way hedid now? In striped drawers, after all ... True, it was  nobody's  business,but still there might be some hitch or delay.     Ivan tore  off  the  buttons where the drawers  fastened at the  ankle,figuring that  this way they might pass for summer trousers, gathered up theicon, the candle and the matches, and started off, saying to himself:     'To Griboedov's! Beyond all doubt, he's there.'     Thecity was already living its  evening life.  Trucks flew through thedust, chains clanking, and on  their platforms men lay sprawled  belly up onsacks. All windows  were open. In each of these windows a light burned underan orange lampshade, and from every window, every door, every gateway, roof,and attic, basement  and  courtyard blared the hoarse roar of the  polonaisefrom the opera Evgeny Onegin.[4]      Ivan Nikolaevich's apprehensions proved fully justified: passers-by didpay  attention  to him  and  turned their heads.  As  a result, he  took thedecision to  leave  the  main streets  and  make his way through back lanes,where people are not so importunate, where there were fewer chances  of thempicking on a  barefoot man, pestering him with questions about  his drawers,which stubbornly refused to look like trousers.     This Ivan did, and,  penetrating the mysterious network of lanes aroundthe Arbat, he began making his way along the walls, casting fearful sidelongglances, turning around every moment, hidingin gateways frori time to time,avoiding  intersections  with  traffic  lights and  the  grand  entrances ofembassy mansions.     And all along his difficult way,  he was for some  reason inexpressiblytormented by the  ubiquitous  orchestra  that accompanied  the  heavy  bassosinging about his love for Tatiana.
CHAPTER 5. There were Doings at Griboedov's       The  old,  two-storeyed,  cream-coloured  house   stood   on  the  ringboulevard, in the depths of a seedy garden, separated from the sidewalk by afancy cast-iron fence.  The small  terrace in front of the  house  was pavedwith asphalt, and in wintertime was dominated by a  snow pile with  a shovelstuck in it, but in summertime turned into  the most  magnificent section ofthe summer restaurant under a canvas tent.     The house was called  'The House of  Griboedov' on the  grounds that itwas  alleged  to have  once  belonged  to  an  aunt of the writer  AlexanderSergeevich Griboedov.[1] Now, whether it did or did not belong toher, we do not  exactly know. On recollection,  it even seems that Griboedovnever had any  such house-owning  aunt . . . Nevertheless, that was what thehouse was called. Moreover, one Moscow liar had it that there, on the secondfloor, in a round hall with columns,  the famous writer  had supposedly readpassages  from Woe From Wit  to this very  aunt while she reclined on a sofa.However,devil knows, maybe he did, it's of no importance.     What is important is that at the  present time this house was owned  bythat  same  Massolit  which had  been  headed  by  the  unfortunate  MikhailAlexandrovich Berlioz before his appearance at the Patriarch's Ponds.     In the casual manner  of Massolit  members, no one called the house TheHouse of Griboedov', everyone simply said 'Griboedov's': 'I spent two  hoursyesterday knocking  about Griboedov's.' 'Well, and so?' 'Got  myself a monthin Yalta.' 'Bravo!' Or: 'Go to Berlioz, he receives today from four to  fiveat Griboedov's . . .' and so on.     Massolit had settled itself at Griboedov's in the  best and cosiest wayimaginable.  Anyone entering  Griboedov's  first of all became involuntarilyacquainted with the announcements of various sports clubs, and with group aswell  as  individual  photographs of the members of Massolit,  hanging  (thephotographs) on the walls of the staircase leading to the second floor.     On the door to  the very first room of thisupper floor one could see abig sign: 'Fishing and Vacation Section',  along with the  picture of a carpcaught on a line.     On  the  door  of room  no. 2  something not  quite  comprehensible waswritten: 'One-day Creative Trips. Apply to M. V. Spurioznaya.'     The  next   door  bore  a   brief  but  now  totally   incomprehensibleinscription: 'Perelygino'.[2] After which  the  chance visitor toGriboedov's would not  know where to look from the motley inscriptions on theaunt's walnut  doors:  'Sign  up  for  Paper  with  Poklevkina',  'Cashier','Personal Accounts of Sketch-Writers'. . .     If one cut through the longest line, which already went downstairs  andout to the doorman's lodge, one could see  the sign  'Housing Question' on adoor which people were crashing every second.     Beyond  the housing  question  there  opened out  a luxurious poster onwhich a cliff was  depicted and, riding  on its crest, a horseman  in a feltcloak with  a  rifle on his  shoulder.  A little lower  -- palm  trees and abalcony; on the balcony -- a  seated  young  man  with a  forelock,  gazingsomewhere aloft  with very lively  eyes, holding a fountain pen in his hand.The   inscription:   'Full-scale   Creative   Vacations   from   Two   Weeks(Story/Novella)  to  One  Year  (Novel/Trilogy).  Yalta,  Suuk-Su,  Borovoe,Tsikhidziri, Makhindzhauri, Leningrad (Winter  Palace).'[3] Therewas also a line at this door, but not an excessive  one  -- some hundred andfifty people.     Next, obedient  to the  whimsical curves,  ascents  and descents of theGriboedov  house, came the  'Massolit Executive Board', 'Cashiers nos. 2, 3,4, 5', 'Editorial  Board', 'Chairman of Massolit', 'Billiard  Room', variousauxiliary institutions and, finally, that same hall with the colonnade wherethe aunt had delighted in the comedy other genius nephew.     Any visitor finding himself in  Griboedov's,  unless of course he was atotal dim-wit, would realize at once what  a good life  those lucky fellows,the Massolit  members,  were  having, and black envy would immediatelystartgnawing at him. And he would immediately address bitter reproaches to heavenfor not having endowed  him  at birth  with  literary  talent, lacking whichthere was naturally no dreaming of owning a Massolit membership card, brown,smelling of costly leather, with  a wide gold border -- a card known  to allMoscow.     Who will speak in  defence of  envy? This  feeling belongs to the nastycategory, but all the  same one must  put oneself in the visitor's position.For what he  had seen on the upper floor was not all, and  was far from all.The entire  ground  floor of the  aunt's house was occupied by a restaurant,and what a restaurant! It was justly considered  the best in Moscow. And notonly because it  took up two vast  halls with arched ceilings, painted  withviolet, Assyrian-maned horses, not only because on each  table there stood alamp  shaded with  a shawl,  not only because it was  not accessible to justanybody coming in  off the  street, but because in the  quality of its  fareGriboedov's beat any restaurantin Moscow up  and down,  and  this fare  wasavailable at the most reasonable, by no means onerous, price.     Hence  there was nothing  surprising, for  instance, in  the  followingconversation, which  the author of these most truthful lines once heard nearthe cast-iron fence of Griboedov's:     'Where are you dining today, Amvrosy?'     'What  a  question! Why,  here, of  course,  my  dear  Foka!  ArchibaldArchibaldovich  whispered  to me today  that  there will be perch au natureldone to order. A virtuoso little treat!'     'You  sure know how to  live, Amvrosy!' skinny, run-down Foka,  with  acarbuncle  on his  neck,  replied  with a sigh to  the  ruddy-lipped  giant,golden-haired, plump-cheeked Amvrosy-the-poet.     'I  have  no special knowledge,' Amvrosy  protested, 'just the ordinarywish to  live like a  human being. You  mean to say, Foka, that perch can bemet with  at  the Coliseum  as well. But at the  Coliseum a portion of perchcosts thirteen roubles fifteen kopecks, and here --  five-fifty! Besides,atthe  Coliseum  they  serve  three-day-old  perch,  and, besides, there's  noguarantee you won't get slapped in the  mug with a bunch  of  grapes  at theColiseum by the  first young man who bursts in from  Theatre  Alley. No, I'mcategorically  opposed  to the Coliseum,'  the gastronome Amvrosv boomed forthe whole boulevard to hear. 'Don't try to convince me, Foka!'     'I'm not trying to convince you, Amvrosy,' Foka squeaked. 'One can alsodine at home.'     'I  humbly thank you,' trumpeted Amvrosy, 'but I can imagine your wife,in the communal kitchen at home, trying to do perch au naturel to order in asaucepan! Hee, hee, hee! ... Aurevwar, Foka!' And, humming, Amvrosy directedhis steps to the veranda under the tent.     Ahh, yes! ... Yes, there was  a time! ...  Old Muscovites will rememberthe renowned Griboedov's! What is poached perch done to order!     Cheap stuff, my dear Amvrosy! But sterlet, sterlet in a silvery chafingdish,  sterlet slices interiaid  with crayfish tails and  fresh caviar?  Andeggs en  cocotte with mushroom puree in little dishes? And how did you likethe  fillets of thrush?  With truffles? Quail  a la genoise? Nine-fifty! Andthe jazz,  and the courteous service! And in  July, when the whole family isin the  country, and you are kept in the city by urgent literary business  -on the veranda, in the shade of the creeping vines, in a golden spot  on thecleanest of  tablecloths, a bowl of soup printanier? Remember, Amvrosy?  Butwhy ask! I can  see by  your lips that you do. What is your  whitefish, yourperch! But the snipe, the great snipe, the jack snipe, the woodcock in theirseason,  the  quail, the curlew? Cool seltzer fizzing in  your throat?!  Butenough, you are getting distracted, reader! Follow me!. . .     At  half past ten on the evening when Berlioz  died at  the Patriarch'sPonds, only one room  was lit upstairs at  Griboedov's, and in it languishedtwelve writers  who had gathered for  a meeting and were waiting for MikhailAlexandrovich.     Sitting on chairs,  and on tables, and even on the two window-sills inthe office of the Massolit executive board, they suffered seriously from theheat. Not a single breath of fresh air came through the open windows. Moscowwas releasing the heat accumulated in the asphalt all day, and  it was clearthat night would bring no relief. The smell of onions came from the basementof the aunt's house, where the restaurant kitchen was at work, they were allthirsty, they were all nervous and angry.     The  belletrist  Beskudnikov  -  a  quiet,  decently  dressed man  withattentive  and at the same rime elusive  eyes - took out his watch. The handwas  crawling towards eleven. Beskudnikov tapped his finger  on the face andshowed it to the poet Dvubratsky,  who was  sitting next to him on the tableand in boredom dangling his feet shod in yellow shoes with rubber treads.     'Anyhow,' grumbled Dvubratsky.     "The laddie must've got stuck  on the Klyazma,'  came the  thick-voicedresponse  of Nastasya Lukinishna  Nepremenova, orphan of  a Moscow merchant,who  had become  a writer and wrote  stories  about sea  battles  under thepen-name of Bos'n George.     'Excuse me!' boldly exclaimed Zagrivov,  an author of popular sketches,'but I personally  would prefer a spot of  tea  on the balcony to stewing inhere. The meeting was set for ten o'clock, wasn't it?'     'It's nice  now on  the Klyazma,' Bos'n George  needled  those present,knowing that Perelygino on the Klyazma, the country colony for  writers, waseverybody's  sore spot. 'There's nightingales singing already. I always workbetter in the country, especially in spring.'     'It's the third year I've paid in so as to send my wife with goitre  tothis  paradise,  but there's  nothing  to be  spied  amidst  the waves,' thenovelist leronym Poprikhin said venomously and bitterly.     'Some are lucky  and some aren't,'  the critic  Ababkov droned from thewindow-sill.     Bos'n George's little eyes lit up wim glee, and she said, softening hercontralto:     We    mustn't     be    envious,     comrades.    There's    twenty-twodachas[4] in all,and only  seven more  being  built, and there'sthree thousand of us in Massolit.'     'Three  thousand  one  hundred and  eleven,'  someone  put in from  thecorner.     'So you see,' the Bos'n went on, 'what can be done? Naturally, it's themost talented of us that got the dachas . . .'     'The generals!' Glukharev the scenarist cut right into the squabble.     Beskudnikov, with an artificial yawn, walked out of the room.     'Five rooms to himself in Perelygino,' Glukharev said behind him.     'Lavrovich  has six to himself,'  Deniskin cried out,  'and  the diningroom's panelled in oak!'     'Eh, that's not  the point right now,'  Ababkov droned, 'it's that it'shalf past eleven.'     A  clamour  arose, something like  rebellion was brewing. They  startedtelephoning hated Perelygino, got  the wrong dacha,  Lavrovich's, found  outthat Lavrovich had  gone to the river, which  made them  totally upset. Theycalled at random to the commission on fine literature, extension 950, and ofcourse found no one there.     'Hemight have called!' shouted Deniskin, Glukharev and Quant.     Ah, they were shouting  in  vain: Mikhail  Alexandrovich could not callanywhere.  Far,  far   from   Griboedov's,  in  an  enormous   room  lit  bythousand-watt bulbs, on three zinc tables, lay what  had still recently beenMikhail Alexandrovich.     On the  first  lay  the naked body, covered with  dried blood, one  armbroken, the chest caved  in;  on the second,  the head with the  front teethknocked out,  with dull, open eyes unafraid of the  brightest  light; and onthe third, a pile of stiffened rags.     Near the  beheaded  body  stood  a professor of  forensic  medicine,  apathological   anatomist  and  his   dissector,   representatives   of   theinvestigation, and Mikhail Alexandrovich's assistant in Massolit, the writerZheldybin, summoned by telephone from his sick wife's side.     A car  had come for Zheldybin  and first of all taken him together withthe  investigators (this was around  midnight) to the dead  man's apartment,where the sealingof his papers had been carried out,  after  which they allwent to the morgue.     And  now  those  standing by the remains of the deceased  were debatingwhat was the better thing to  do: to sew the severed head to the neck, or tolay out the body in the hall at Griboedov's  after simply covering the  deadman snugly to the chin with a black cloth?     No,  Mikhail Alexandrovich  could  not  call  anywhere,  and  Deniskin,Glukharev  and  Quant,  along with  Beskudnikov, were  being  indignant  andshouting quite  in vain. Exactly at  midnight, all  twelve  writers left theupper floor and descended to the restaurant. Here again they silendy beratedMikhail Alexandrovich: all  the  tables  on  the  veranda,  naturally,  wereoccupied, and  they  had to stay for  supper in  those beautiful but airlesshalls.     And  exactly  at midnight,  in  the  first  of these  halls,  somethingcrashed,  jangled, spilled,  leaped. And  all  at once  a  high  male  voicedesperately cried out  'Hallelujah!' to the music. The famous Griboedovjazzband struck up.  Sweat-covered  faces  seemed to brighten, it was as if  thehorses  painted on the  ceiling came  alive, the lamps seemed  to  shine withadded light, and suddenly, as if tearing loose, both halls broke into dance,and following them the veranda broke into dance.     Glukharev  danced  with the poetess  Tamara Polumesyats, Quant  danced,Zhukopov  the novelist danced with some  movie actress in  a  yellow  dress.Dragunsky  danced,  Cherdakchi  danced,  little  Deniskin  danced  with  theenormous Bos'n George, the beautiful Semeikina-Gall, an architect, danced inthe tight embrace of a stranger in white canvas trousers. Locals and invitedguests  danced,  Muscovites  and  out-of-towners,  the  writer  Johann  fromKronstadt, a  certain Vitya Kuftik from Rostov, apparendy a  stage director,with a purple  spot all  over his cheek, the most eminent representatives ofthe poetry  section  of  Massolit danced - that  is,  Baboonov, Blasphemsky,Sweetkin,  Smatchstik   and   Addphina  Buzdyak  --  young  men of  unknownprofession, in crew cuts, with cotton-padded shoulders, danced, someone veryelderly danced, a  shred  of green onion  stuck in his  beard, and with  himdanced a sickly, anaemia-consumed girl in a wrinkled orange silk dress.     Streaming with sweat, waiters carried sweating mugs  of beer over theirheads, shouting  hoarsely  and with  hatred: 'Excuse me, citizen!' Somewherethrough a megaphone a voice commanded: 'One  Karsky shashlik! Two Zubrovkas!Home-style tripe!' The high voice  no longer sang, but  howled 'Hallelujah!'The clashing of golden cymbals in the  band sometimes  even drowned  out theclashing of dishes  which the dishwashers  sent down a  sloping chute to thekitchen. In short - hell.     And at midnight there came an apparition in hell. A  handsome dark-eyedman  with  a dagger-like beard, in a tailcoat, stepped on to the veranda andcast a regal glance over his  domain. They used to say, the mystics  used tosay,  that there  was a time when the handsome man wore not a tailcoat but awide leatherbelt with pistol butts sticking from it, and his raven hair wastied with scarlet silk, and  under  his  command a brig sailed the Caribbeanunder a black death flag with a skull and crossbones.     But no, no! The  seductive mystics are  lying,  there are  no CaribbeanSeas  in the world, no desperate  freebooters sail them, no  corvette chasesafter them, no cannon smoke drifts across the waves.  There is  nothing, andthere  was nothing!  There is that  sickly  linden over there, there  is thecast-iron fence, and  the boulevard beyond it ... And the ice is  melting inthe bowl, and at  the  next table  you see someone's bloodshot, bovine eyes,and you're afraid, afraid . . . Oh, gods, my gods,  poison, bring me poison!.. .     And suddenly a word fluttered up from  some table: 'Berlioz!!' The jazzbroke up and fell silent, as if someone had hit it with a fist. 'What, what,what, what?!!' 'Berlioz!!!' And they began jumping up, exclaiming...     Yes, a  wave of grief billowed  up at  the terrible  news about MikhailAlexandrovich.Someone fussed about, crying that  it  was necessary at once,straight away, without leaving the spot, to compose some collective telegramand send it off immediately.     But  what telegram, may we ask, and  where? And why send it? And where,indeed? And  what  possible need  for any telegram  does someone have  whoseflattened pate is now clutched  in the  dissector's rubber hands, whose neckthe professor is now piercing  with curved  needles?  He's dead,  and has noneed of any telegrams. It's  all over, let's not burden  the telegraph wiresany more.     Yes, he's dead, dead . . . But, as for us, we're alive!     Yes, a wave of grief billowed up, held out for a while, but  then beganto subside, and  somebody went back  to  his table and -- sneakily at first,then openly - drank a little vodka and ate  a bite. And, really, can one letchicken cutlets de volatile perish? How  can  we help Mikhail Alexandrovich?By going hungry? But, after all, we're alive!     Naturally, the grand piano was locked, the ja2z band dispersed,severaljournalists left for their offices to write obituaries. It became known thatZheldybin  had  come  from  the  morgue.  He  had  installed himself  in thedeceased's office upstairs, and the rumour spread at once that it was he whowould replace Berlioz. Zheldybin  summoned from  the  restaurant all  twelvemembers  of the  board, and  at the urgently  convened meeting in  Berlioz'soffice they started a discussion of the pressing questions of decorating thehall with columns  at  Griboedov's, of transporting the body from the morgueto that hall, of opening  it  to the public, and all else connected with thesad event.     And the restaurant  began to live  its  usual nocturnal life  and wouldhave gone on living it until  closing time, that is,  until four  o'clock inthe morning, had it not been for  an  occurrence which was completely out ofthe ordinary and which  struck the restaurant's clientele much more than thenews of Berlioz's death.     The first to take alarm were the coachmen[5] waiting  at thegates of the Griboedov house. One of them, rising on his box, was heard  tocry out:     'Hoo-ee! Just look at that!'     After  which,  from  God knows where, a  little  light  flashed  by thecast-iron fence  and  began  to approach the veranda. Those  sitting  at thetables began to get up and peer at it,  and saw  that along with the  littlelight a white ghost was marching towards  the restaurant. When it came rightup to the trellis, everybody  sat as  if  frozen at their tables, chunks  ofsterlet  on their forks, eyes popping.  The doorman, who at that moment  hadstepped out of the restaurant coat room to have a smoke in the yard, stampedout  his  cigarette  and made for  the  ghost  with the obvious intention ofbarring its way into the restaurant, but for some reason did not do  so, andstopped, smiling stupidly.     And  the  ghost, passing  through an opening  in the  trellis,  steppedunhindered on to the veranda. Here everyone saw that it was no ghost at all,but Ivan Nikolaevich Homeless, the much-renowned poet.    He was barefoot, in a  torn, whitish Tolstoy blouse, with  a paper iconbearing the  image of  an unknown saint pinned to  the  breast of it  with asafety  pin,  and  was  wearing  striped  white  drawers. In  his  hand IvanNikolaevich carried a lighted wedding candle. Ivan Nikolaevich's right cheekwas freshly scratched. It would even be difficult to plumb the depths of thesilence that reigned  on the  veranda. Beer could be seen running down on tothe floor from a mug tilted in one waiter's hand.     The poet raised the candle over his head and said loudly:     'Hail, friends!'  After  which he  peeked  under the  nearest table andexclaimed ruefully: 'No, he's not there!'     Two voices were heard. A basso said pitilessly:     That's it. Delirium tremens.'     And the second, a woman's, frightened, uttered the words:     'How could the police let him walk the streets like that?'     This Ivan Nikolaevich heard, and replied:     They tried to detain me twice, in Skaterny and here on Bronnaya,  but Ihopped  over the  fence and,  as  you  can see, cut  my  cheek!' Here  IvanNikolaevich raised the  candle and cried out: 'Brethren in literature!' (Hishoarse voice grew stronger and more fervent.) 'Listen to me everyone! He hasappeared. Catch him immediately, otherwise he'll do untold harm!'     'What? What? What did he say?  Who has appeared?' voices came  from allsides.     The consultant,' Ivan  replied, 'and  this consultant just killed MishaBerlioz at the Patriarch's Ponds.'     Here people came flocking to the veranda from the inner rooms,  a crowdgathered around Ivan's flame.     'Excuse  me, excuse me, be more precise,'  a soft and polite voice saidover Ivan Nikolaevich's ear, 'tell me, what do you mean "killed"?     Who killed?'     'A foreign consultant,  a professor, and  a  spy,'  Ivan  said, lookingaround.     'And what  is his name?' came sofdy to Ivan's ear. That's just it - hisname!'  Ivan cried in anguish. 'If only  I knew  his name! I didn't make outhis name on his visiting card ... I only rememberthe first letter, "W", hisname  begins with "W"! What last name  begins with "W"?' Ivan asked himself,clutching his forehead, and  suddenly started muttering: 'Wi, we, wa ...  Wu... Wo ... Washner? Wagner? Weiner? Wegner? Winter?' The hair on Ivan's headbegan to crawl with the tension.     'Wolf?' some woman cried pitifully.     Ivan became angry.     'Fool!' he cried, seeking the woman with  his eyes. "What has Wolf  gotto do with it? Wolf's not to blame for anything! Wo, wa . .. No,  I'll neverremember this way! Here's what,  citizens: call the police at once, let themsend  out five motor cycles with  machine-guns to  catch the professor.  Anddon't  forget  to  tell  them that there are two  others  with  him: a  longcheckered one, cracked pince-nez, and a cat, black and fat ... And meanwhileI'll search Griboedov's, I sense that he's here!'     Ivan became anxious, pushed away the  people around him, started wavingthe  candle,  pouring  wax on himself, and  looking  under  thetables. Heresomeone  said:  'Call  a doctor!' and someone's  benign, fleshy  face, cleanshaven and well nourished, in horn-rimmed glasses, appeared before Ivan.     'Comrade Homeless,' the  face  began  in a guest speaker's voice, 'calmdown! You're upset at  the death of our beloved  Mikhail  Alexandrovich . ..no, say just Misha Berlioz. We all  understand that perfectly well. You needrest. The comrades will take you home to bed right now, you'll forget. . .'     'You,' Ivan interrupted, baring  his teeth, "but don't  you  understandthat  the  professor  has  to  be  caught? And  you  come  at  me with  yourfoolishness! Cretin!'     'Pardon  me.  Comrade   Homeless!...'  the   face  replied,   blushing,retreating, and already repentant at having got mixed up in this affair.     'No, anyone  else, but you I will  not pardon,'  Ivan Nikolaevich  saidwith quiet hatred.     A spasm  distorted  his  face, he quickly  shifted the candle from  hisright hand  to his left, swung roundly and hit the compassionate faceon theear.     Here  it  occurred to them to fall  upon Ivan  -  and so they  did. Thecandle  went  out,  and  the  glasses  that had  fallen  from  the face wereinstantly  trampled.  Ivan  let  out  a  terrible war  cry,  heard,  to  thetemptation  of all, even on the boulevard, and  set about defending himself.Dishes fell clattering from the tables, women screamed.     All  the while  the  waiters were tying  up  the  poet with  napkins, aconversation was going on in the coat room between the commander of the brigand the doorman.     'Didn't you see he was in his underpants?' the pirate  inquired coldly.'But, Archibald Archibaldovich,' the doorman replied, cowering,     'how could I not let him in, if he's a member of Massolit?' 'Didn't yousee he  was in his underpants?' the pirate  repeated. 'Pardon me,  ArchibaldArchibaldovich,' the doorman said, turning purple, 'but what  could I  do? Iunderstand, there are ladies sitting on the veranda . . .'     'Ladies  have  nothing  to do  with it, it  makes  no differenceto theladies,' the pirate replied, literally burning the doorman up with his eyes,'but it does to the  police! A man in his underwear can walk  the streets ofMoscow only in this one case, that he's accompanied by  the police, and onlyto one place -- the  police station! And  you, if you're a doorman, ought toknow that on seeing  such a man, you  must, without a moment's  delay, startblowing  your  whistle. Do you  hear? Do you  hear what's  going on  on  theveranda?'     Here the half-crazed doorman heard some sort of hooting coming from theveranda, the smashing of dishes and women's screams.     'Now, what's to be done with you for that?' the freebooter asked.     The skin  on the doorman's face acquired a typhoid tinge, his eyes wentdead. It seemed to  him that the  black  hair, now  combed and  parted,  wascovered with  flaming silk. The shirt-front and  tailcoat disappeared and  apistol  butt  emerged,  tucked  into a leather  belt. The  doorman  picturedhimself hanging from  the  fore-topsail yard. His eyessaw  his  own  tonguesticking out and his lifeless head lolling on  his shoulder,  and even heardthe splash of waves against the hull. The doorman's knees gave way. But herethe freebooter took pity on him and extinguished his sharp gaze.     'Watch  out, Nikolai, this is the  last time!  We have no need  of suchdoormen in the restaurant. Go find yourself a job as a beadle.'  Having saidthis,  the commander commanded  precisely,  clearly, rapidly: 'Get  Panteleifrom the snack bar. Police. Protocol. A car. To the psychiatric clinic.' Andadded: 'Blow your whistle!'     In a quarter of an hour  an extremely astounded public, not only in therestaurant but on the boulevard itself and in  the windows of houses lookingon to  the restaurant garden, saw  Pantelei,  the  doorman,  a policeman,  awaiter  and the poet Riukhin  carry through the gates of Griboedov's a youngman  swaddled like a doll, dissolved in tears, who spat, aiming precisely atRiukhin, and shouted for all the boulevard to hear:     'YOU bastard! ... Youbastard!...'     A truck-driver with a spiteful face was starting his motor. Next to hima coachman, rousing his horse, slapping  it  on the croup with violet reins,shouted:     'Have a run for your money! I've taken 'em to the psychics before!'     Around  them the crowd buzzed, discussing the  unprecedented  event. Inshort, there was a nasty, vile, tempting, swinish scandal, which  ended onlywhen the truck carried away from  the gates  of Griboedov's  the unfortunateIvan Nikolaevich, the policeman, Pantelei and Riukhin.
CHAPTER 6. Schizophrenia, as was Said        It was half past one in the morning when a man with a pointed beard andwearing  a  white  coat came  out  to  the  examining  room  of  the  famouspsychiatric clinic, built recently on the outskirts of Moscow by the bank ofthe river. Three  orderlies had their eyes fastened on Ivan Nikolaevich, whowas sitting on a couch. The extremely agitated poet Riukhin was also  there.The napkins with which Ivan Nikolaevich had been bed up lay in a pile on thesame couch. Ivan Nikolaevich's arms and legs were free.     Seeing  the  entering man,  Riukhin  turned  pale,  coughed,  and  saidtimidly:     'Hello, Doctor.'     The doctor bowed to Riukhin but,  as he bowed, looked not at him but atIvan Nikolaevich. The latter sat perfecdy motionless, with an angry face andknitted brows, and did not even stir at the doctor's entrance.     'Here,  Doctor,'  Riukhin  began  speaking,  for  some  reason,   in  amysterious  whisper,  glancing  timorously  at  Ivan  Nikolaevich,  'is  therenowned poet Ivan Homeless .. .well, you see .. . we're afraid it might bedelirium tremens . . .'     'Was he drinking hard?' the doctor said through his teeth.     'No, he drank, but not really so . ..'     'Did he  chase  after cockroaches, rats,  little  devils,  or  slinkingdogs?'     'No,' Riukhin  replied with  a shudder, 'I  saw him yesterday and  thismorning ... he was perfectly well.'     'And why is he in his drawers? Did you get him out of bed?'     'No, Doctor, he came to the restaurant that way ...'     'Aha,  aha,' the  doctor  said with great  satisfaction,  'and why  thescratches? Did he have a fight?'     'He fell off  a fence,  and then  in the restaurant he hit somebody ...and then somebody else . . .'     'So, so,  so,' the doctor  said  and,  turning  to Ivan, added:  'Hellothere!'     'Greetings, saboteur!'' Ivan replied spitefully and loudly.     Riukhin was so embarrassed that he  did not dare raise his eyes to  thecourteous  doctor. But the latter,  not offended in  the least, took off hisglasses  with  a habitual, deftmovement, raised the skirt of  his coat, putthem into the back pocket of his trousers, and then asked Ivan:     'How old are you?'     'YOU can all go to the devil!' Ivan shouted rudely and turned away.     'But why are you angry? Did I say anything unpleasant to you?'     'I'm twenty-three years old,'  Ivan began excitedly,  'and I'll file  acomplaint against you all. And particularly against you, louse!' he advertedseparately to Riukhin.     'And what do you want to complain about?'     'About the fact that I, a healthy man, was seized and dragged by  forceto a madhouse!' Ivan replied wrathfully.     Here Riukhin looked closely at Ivan and went cold: there  was decidedlyno insanity  in  the  man's  eyes.  No  longer  dull  as  dicy  had been  atGriboedov's, they were now clear as ever.     'Good  God!' Riukhin  thought  fearfully. 'So he's really  normal! Whatnonsense! Why, in fact,  did we drag him here? He's normal, normal, only hismug got scratched . . .'     'You are,' the doctor began calmly, sitting downon  a white stool witha shiny foot,  'not  in a madhouse, but in a clinic, where no  one will keepyou if it's not necessary.'     Ivan Nikolaevich glanced at  him mistrustfully out of the  comer of hiseye, but still grumbled:     'Thank the Lord! One normal man has finally turned up among the idiots,of whom the first is that giftless goof Sashka!'     'Who is this giftless Sashka?' the doctor inquired.     'This one here - Riukhin,' Ivan  replied,  jabbing his  dirty finger inRiukhin's direction.     The latter  flushed with  indignation.  That's the  thanks  I get,'  hethought bitterly, 'for showing concern for him! What trash, really!'     'Psychologically,   a   typical   little   kulak,'[2]   IvanNikolaevich began,  evidently from an irresistible urge to denounce Riukhin,'and,  what's  more,  a  little  kulak  carefully  disguising  himself as  aproletarian.  Look  at his  lenten physiognomy,  and  compare it with  thoseresounding verses he wrote for the First of  May[3] -  heh,  heh,heh ... "Soaring up!"and "Soaring down!!" But  if you could look inside himand  see what  he thinks  ... you'd  gasp!' And Ivan Nikolaevich burst  intosinister laughter.     Riukhin  was  breathing heavily, turned  red,  and  thought of just onething, that he had warmed a serpent on his breast, that he had shown concernfor a  man who turned out to be a vicious enemy.  And,  above all, there wasnothing to be done: there's no arguing with the mentally ill!     'And  why, actually, were you  brought  here?'  the doctor asked, afterlistening attentively to Homeless's denunciations.     'Devil take them, the numskulls! They  seized me, tied  me up with somerags, and dragged me away in a truck!'     'May I ask why you came to the restaurant in just your underwear?'     There's  nothing surprising about that,' Ivan  replied. 'I  went for  aswim in the Moscow River, so they filched my clothes and left me this trash!I couldn't very  well walk around Moscow  naked! I  put it  on because I washurrying to Griboedov's restaurant.'    The doctor glanced questioningly at Riukhin, who muttered glumly:     'The name of the restaurant.'     'Aha,'  said  the  doctor,  'and  why were you  in  such a  hurry? Somebusiness meeting?'     'I'm trying to catch the  consultant,' Ivan Nikolaevich said and lookedaround anxiously.     'What consultant?'     'Do you know Berlioz?' Ivan asked significantly.     The . . . composer?'     Ivan got upset.     'What composer? Ah, yes ... Ah, no. The  composer  has the same name asMisha Berlioz.'     Riukhin had no wish to say anything, but was forced to explain:     The secretary of Massolit, Berlioz, was run over  by a tram-car tonightat the Patriarch's Ponds.'     'Don't blab about what you don't know!' Ivan got angry with Riukhin. 'Iwas there, not you! He got him under the tram-car on purpose!'     'Pushed him?'     '"Pushed  him",  nothing!'  Ivan  exclaimed,  angered  by  the  generalobtuseness.  'His kind don't need to push! He can perform such stunts - holdon  to  your hat! He knew  beforehand  that Berlioz  would  get  under  thetram-car!'     'And did anyone besides you see this consultant?'     That's the trouble, it was just Berlioz and I.'     'So.  And what measures did you take to  catch this murderer?' Here thedoctor  turned and sent  a glance towards a  woman in a white coat, who  wassitting  at  a table to one side. She took out  a sheet of  paper  and beganfilling in the blank spaces in its columns.     'Here's what measures: I took a little candle from the kitchen...'     That one?' asked the doctor, pointing to the broken candle lying on thetable in front of the woman, next to the icon.     That very one, and . . .'     'And why the icon?'     'Ah, yes,  the  icon .  .  .'  Ivan  blushed. 'It  was  the  icon  thatfrightened them  most of all.'  He again jabbed his finger  in the directionofRiukhin. 'But the thing  is that  he, the  consultant,  he ... let's speakdirectly . ..  is mixed up with the unclean powers .  .. and you won't catchhim so easily.'     The orderlies for some reason snappedto attention and  fastened  theireyes on Ivan.     Yes, sirs,'  Ivan  went on,  'mixed up with them! An absolute fact.  Hespoke personally with Pontius Pilate.  And  there's no need  to stare  at melike that. I'm telling the truth! He saw everything --  the balcony  and thepalm trees. In short, he was at Pontius Pilate's, I can vouch for it.'     'Come, come .. .'     'Well, so I pinned the icon on my chest and ran .. .'     Here the clock suddenly struck twice.     'Oh-oh!' Ivan exclaimed and  got up from the couch. 'It's  two o'clock,and I'm wasting time with you! Excuse me, where's the telephone?'     'Let him use the telephone,' the doctor told the orderlies.     Ivan  grabbed  the receiver,  and  the  woman  meanwhile  quietly askedRiukhin:     'Is he married?'     'Single,' Riukhin answered fearfully.     'Member of a trade union?'     'Yes.'     'Police?'   Ivan   shouted   into   the   receiver.  'Police?   Comradeofficer-on-duty, give orders at once for five motor cycles with machine-gunsto be sent outto catch the foreign  consultant. What? Come and  pick me up,I'll go with you ...  It's the poet Homeless speaking from the madhouse .. .What's  your address?' Homeless asked the  doctor in a whisper, covering thereceiver with his hand, and then again shouting into it: 'Are you listening?Hello!  ..  .  Outrageous!' Ivan  suddenly  screamed and hurled the receiveragainst the wall. Then he  turned to the  doctor, offered him his hand, said'Goodbye' drily, and made as if to leave.     'For  pity's sake, where do you intend to go?' the doctor said, peeringinto Ivan's  eyes. 'In the dead of night,  in your underwear .. . You're notfeeling well, stay with us.'     'Let  me  pass,'  Ivan said to the  orderlies, who  closed ranks at thedoor. 'Will you let me pass or not?' the poet shouted in a terrible voice.     Riukhin  trembled, but the woman  pushed  a button  on the table  and ashiny little box with a sealed ampoule popped out on to its glass surface.     'Ah,  so?!'  Ivan  said, turning around  with a wild  and hunted look.'Well, then . . . Goodbye!' And he rushed head first into the window-blind.     The  crash was rather  forceful, but the glass behind the blind gave nocrack, and in an instant Ivan Nikolaevich was struggling in the hands of theorderlies. He gasped, tried to  bite, shouted:     'So that's the sort of windows you've got here! Let me go! Let me go! .. .'     A syringe  flashed  in  the  doctor's hand, with  a single movement thewoman  slit the  threadbare sleeve  of  the  shirt and  seized the  arm withunwomanly strength. There was a  smell of ether, Ivan went limp in the handsof the four people, the deft doctor  took advantage of this moment and stuckthe needle into Ivan's arm. They held Ivan for  another few seconds and thenlowered him on to the couch.     'Bandits!' Ivan shouted and jumped up from the couch, but was installedon it again. The moment they let go of him, he again jumped up, but sat backdown  by himself. He paused, gazing around wildly, then unexpectedly yawned,then smiled maliciously.     'Lockedme up after all,' he said, yawned again, unexpectedly lay down,put his  head  on  the pillow,  his fist under his  head  like a  child, andmuttered now in a sleepy voice, without  malice: 'Very well, then ... you'llpay for it yourselves ... I've warned  you, you  can do as you like ...  I'mnow interested most of all in Pontius Pilate ... Pilate  ...', and he closedhis eyes.     'A bath,  a private  room, number 117,  and  a nurse to watch him,' thedoctor ordered as  he put his glasses on. Here  Riukhin again gave a  start:the white  door  opened noiselessly, behind it a corridor could be seen, litby blue night-lights. Out  of  the corridor rolled  a  stretcher  on  rubberwheels, to  which the  quieted Ivan was transferred, and  then he rolled offdown the corridor and the door closed behind him.     'Doctor,' the shaken Riukhin  asked in a whisper, 'it means he's reallyill?'     'Oh, yes,' replied the doctor.     'But what's wrong with him, then?' Riukhin asked timidly.     The tired doctor glanced at Riukhin andanswered listlessly:     'Locomotor and speech excitation . . .  delirious interpretations ... Acomplex case, it seems.  Schizophrenia,  I suppose. Plus this alcoholism . ..'     Riukhin understood nothing from the  doctor's words, except that thingswere evidently not so great with Ivan Nikolaevich. He sighed and asked:     'But what's all this talk of his about some consultant?'     'He  must have seen  somebody who struck his disturbed imagination.  Ormaybe a hallucination ...'     A  few minutes later the truck was carrying  Riukhin off to Moscow. Daywas breaking,  and  the light  of the street lights still burning  along thehighway was  now unnecessary and unpleasant. The driver was vexed at  havingwasted  the night, drove the truck  as fast as  he could, and skidded on theturns.     Now the woods dropped off, stayed somewhere behind, and  the river wentsomewhere to the side, and an  omnium  gatherum came  spilling  to  meet thetruck: fences with sentry boxes and stacks of wood, tall posts and some sortof poles,with spools strung on the poles, heaps of rubble, the earth scoredby canals -- in short,  you sensed that she was there, Moscow, right  there,around the turn, and about to heave herself upon you and engulf you.     Riukhin  was jolted and tossed  about; the sort of stump he had  placedhimself on kept trying  to slide out from under him. The restaurant napkins,thrown in by the policeman and Pantelei, who  had left earlier by bus, movedall  around the  flatbed. Riukhin tried to collect  them, but then, for somereason hissing spitefully: 'Devil take them! What  am I doing fussing like afool? ...', he spumed them aside with his foot and stopped looking at them.     The rider's state of mind was terrible. It was  becoming clear that hisvisit to the house of sorrow had left the deepest mark on him. Riukhin triedto understand what was tormenting him. The corridor with  blue lights, whichhad  stuck  itself  to  his  memory?  The  thought that there  is no greatermisfortune in the world than the loss of reason?  Yes, yes,of course, that,too. But that - that's only a general thought. There's something  else. Whatis it? An insult, that's what. Yes, yes, insulting words hurled right in hisface by Homeless. And the trouble is not that  they were insulting, but thatthere was truth in them.     The  poet no longer looked around, but, staring into the dirty, shakingfloor, began muttering something, whining, gnawing at himself.     Yes, poetry ... He was thirty-two years old! And, indeed, what then? Sothen he  would go on writing  his  several poems a year. Into old  age? Yes,into old age. What would these poems bring him? Glory? 'What nonsense! Don'tdeceive  yourself, at least. Glory will never come to someone who writes badpoems. What makes them  bad? The  truth, he was  telling the truth!' Riukhinaddressed himself mercilessly. 'I don't believe in anything I write! . . .'     Poisoned  bv this  burst of  neurasthenia,  the poet swayed,  the floorunder  him stopped shaking. Riukhin raised his head and saw that he had longbeen in  Moscow,and,  what's more, that it was dawn  over Moscow,  that thecloud was underlit with gold, that his truck had stopped, caught in a columnof  other  vehicles at the turn on to the boulevard, and  that very close tohim on a pedestal stood a  metal man, his head  inclined slightly, gazing atthe boulevard with indifference.     Some strange thoughts flooded the head of  the ailing poet. 'There's anexample of real  luck.  . .' Here Riukhin rose  to  his full height  on  theflatbed  of  the truck  and  raised his arm,  for some reason attacking  thecast-iron man who was  not bothering anyone. 'Whatever step he  made in  hislife, whatever happened to  him, it all turned to his benefit, it all led tohis glory!  But what did  he  do? I  can't conceive ...  Is  there  anythingspecial in the words: "The snowstorm covers . . ."? I don't understand! .. .Luck, sheer luck!' Riukhin concluded with venom,  and  felt the truck movingunder him.  'He  shot him, that white  guard shot  him, smashed his hip, andassured his immortality...'    The column began to move. In no more  than  two minutes, the completelyill  and even aged poet was entering the veranda of Griboedov's.  It was nowempty. In a corner some company was finishing its drinks,  and in the middlethe familiar master of  ceremonies  was bustling about, wearing  a skullcap,with a glass of Abrau wine in his hand.     Riukhin,  laden   with   napkins,   was   met   affably  by   ArchibaldArchi-baldovich and at once relieved  of the cursed  rags.  Had Riukhin  notbecome so  worn out in the  clinic and on the truck, he would certainly havederived  pleasure from telling how everything had gone  in  the hospital andembellishing the story  with invented details. But just then he was far fromsuch things,  and, little  observant  though  Riukhin  was, now,  after  thetorture on the truck, he peered keenly at the pirate for the first time  andrealized  that,  though the  man  asked about  Homeless  and  even exclaimed'Ai-yai-yai!', he was essentially quite indifferent  to  Homeless's fate anddid not  feel a bit sorry for him.  'And bravo!  Right  you  are!'  Riukhinthought  with cynical, self-annihilating malice and, breaking off  the storyabout the schizophrenia, begged:     'Archibald  Archibaldovich,  a drop of  vodka  . ..' The pirate made  acompassionate face and whispered:     'I understand . . . this very minute . . .' and beckoned to a waiter. Aquarter of an hour later, Riukhin sat in complete solitude, hunched over hisbream, drinking glass after glass, understanding and recognizing that it wasno longer  possible to  set  anything right in  his life, that  it was  onlypossible to forget.     The  poet  had  wasted his night  while  others  were feasting and  nowunderstood  that it was impossible to get it  back. One needed only to raiseone's head  from  the  lamp  to  the  sky to understand  that  the night wasirretrievably lost. Waiters were hurriedly tearing the  tablecloths from thetables. The  cats  slinking  around  the veranda  had  a morning  look.  Dayirresistibly heaved itself upon thepoet.
CHAPTER 7. A Naughty Apartment        If Styopa Likhodeev had  been told the next morning: 'Styopa! You'll beshot if  you don't get  up this minute!' --  Styopa would have replied in  alanguid, barely audible voice: 'Shoot me, do what  you like with me, I won'tget up.'     Not only not get up, it seemed to him  that he could not open his eyes,because if he were to do so,  there would be a  flash of  lightning, and hishead  would  at once  be  blown to pieces. A heavy bell was booming  in thathead, brown  spots rimmed with fiery green floated between  his eyeballs andhis  closed eyelids, and to crown it all he was nauseous, this nausea, as itseemed  to  him,  being  connected  with  the  sounds  of  some  importunategramophone.     Styopa tried to recall something, but only one thing would get recalled-- that yesterday,  apparently, and in some unknown place, he had stood witha  napkin in his  hand and tried to  kiss some lady,  promising her that thenext day, and  exactly  at noon,  he would come to  visit her.  The lady haddeclined, saying:  'No, no, I  won't be home!', but  Styopa  had stubbornlyinsisted: 'And I'll just up and come anyway!'     Who the lady  was, and  what time it was now,  what day, of what month,Styopa decidedly did not know, and, worst  of  all,  he could not figure outwhere  he was. He attempted to learn this last  at  least,  and to  that endunstuck  the stuck-together lids of his left eye. Something gleamed dully inthe semi-darkness. Styopa  finally  recognized the  pier-glass  and realizedthat he  was  lying on  his back in his  own  bed  - that is, the jeweller'swife's  former bed  -  in the  bedroom. Here he felt such a throbbing in hishead that he closed his eyes and moaned.     Let us explain: Styopa Likhodeev, director of  the Variety Theatre, hadcome to his  senses that morning at  home,  in the very  apartment  which heshared with the late Berlioz, in  a big, six-storeyed, U-shaped building  onSadovaya Street.     It must be said that this apartment  - no.50 -  had long  had, if not abad, at least a strangereputation. Two years ago  it had still belonged  tothe  widow  of  the jeweller de  Fougeray. Anna  Frantsevna  de Fougeray,  arespectable and  very practical fifty-year-old woman,  let out three of  thefive  rooms  to  lodgers:  one  whose last name was apparently Belomut,  andanother with a lost last name.     And  then  two years ago inexplicable events  began  to  occur in  thisapartment: people began to disappear' from this apartment without a trace.     Once, on  a  day off, a  policeman  came to  the apartment,  called thesecond lodger (the one whose last name got lost) out to the  front hall, andsaid he was invited to come to the police station  for  a  minute to put hissignature to something. The lodger told  Anfisa, Anna Frantsevna's long-timeand  devoted housekeeper, to say, in case  he received any  telephone calls,that he would be back  in  ten  minutes, and left together with  the proper,white-gloved policeman. He not only did  not come  back in  ten minutes, butnever came back at  all. The mostsurprising  thing  was that the  policemanevidently vanished along with him.     The  pious, or, to speak  more  frankly, superstitious Anfisa  declaredoutright to  the very upset Anna Frantsevna that it was sorcery and that sheknew perfectly well  who had stolen both the lodger  and the policeman, onlyshe did not wish to talk about it towards night-time.     Well, but with sorcery, as  everyone knows,  once it starts, there's nostopping  it. The  second lodger  is  remembered  to  have disappeared on  aMonday, and that Wednesday Belomut seemed to drop from sight, though,  true,under different circumstances. In the morning a car came,  as usual, to takehim  to  work, and it did take him to work, but it did not bring anyone backor come again itself.     Madame  Belomut's  grief  and horror  defied  description.  But,  alas,neither  the  one nor the other  continued for  long.  That  same  night, onreturning with Anfisa from her dacha, which Anna Frantsevna had  hurried offto for  some reason, she did not find  the wife of citizen  Belomut  in theapartment.  And not only that: the  doors of  the  two rooms occupied by theBelomut couple turned out to be sealed.     Two  days passed  somehow.  On the third  day, Anna Frantsevna, who hadsuffered all the while from insomnia, again left hurriedly for her dacha . .. Needless to say, she never came back!     Left alone,  Anfisa,  having wept her  fill,  went  to  sleep past  oneo'clock  in  the morning. What happened to her after that is not  known, butlodgers in  other apartments told of hearing some sort of knocking all nightin  no.50 and of seeing electric light burning  in the windows till morning.In the morning it turned out that there was also no Anfisa!     For a long time all sorts of legends  were  repeated in the house aboutthese  disappearances  and  about  the  accursed  apartment,  such  as,  forinstance, 'that this dry  and pious little  Anfisa had supposedly carried onher  dried-up breast, in a suede bag, twenty-five big diamonds  belonging toAnna Frantsevna. Thatin  the woodshed of  that  very dacha  to  which  AnnaFrantsevna had gone so hurriedly, there supposedly turned up, of themselves,some inestimable treasures  in the form of those  same diamonds,  plus  somegold coins of tsarist minting ... And so on, in the same vein. Well, what wedon't know, we can't vouch for.     However it may have been, the apartment stood empty and sealed for onlya week. Then the late Berlioz moved in  with his wife, and this same Styopa,also  with his wife. It was perfectly natural that, as soon as they got intothe  malignant  apartment, devil  knows  what started happening with them aswell! Namely, within the space of a month both wives vanished. But these twonot without a trace. Of Berlioz's wife it  was told that  she had supposedlybeen seen in Kharkov with some  ballet-master, while Styopa's wife allegedlyturned up on Bozhedomka  Street, where wagging  tongues said the director ofthe Variety, using his innumerable acquaintances, had contrived to get her aroom, but on the one conditionthat  she never show her face on Sadovaya . ..     And so, Styopa moaned. He wanted to call the housekeeper Grunya and askher for aspirin, but was still able to realize that it was foolish, and thatGrunya,  of course,  had no aspirin.  He  tried  to call  Berlioz  for help,groaned  twice: 'Misha  . . . Misha  .  ..',  but,  as you  will understand,received no reply. The apartment was perfectly silent.     Moving his toes, Styopa realized that he was lying there in his  socks,passed  his trembling  hand  down  his  hip to determine whether he had  histrousers on or  not, but failed.  Finally,  seeing that he was abandoned andalone,  and there  was no  one to  help  him, he decided to get up,  howeverinhuman the effort it cost him.     Styopa  unstuck his glued  eyelids  and  saw  himself  reflected in thepier-glass as a man with hair sticking out in all directions, with a bloatedphysiognomy covered with black  stubble,  with puffy  eyes, a  dirty  shirt,collar and necktie, in drawers and socks.     So he saw himself in the pier-glass, and next to  the mirror he saw anunknown man, dressed in black and wearing a black beret.     Styopa sat up in bed and goggled his bloodshot eyes as well as he couldat the unknown man. The  silence was broken by this unknown man, who said ina low, heavy voice, and with a foreign accent, the following words:     'Good morning, my most sympathetic Stepan Bogdanovich!'     There was  a pause,  after which, making  a  most  terrible  strain  onhimself, Styopa uttered:     "What can I do for  you?'  - and was  amazed, not  recognizing his  ownvoice. He  spoke the word 'what' in a treble, 'can I' in a bass, and his 'dofor you' did not come off at all.     The stranger  smiled amicably, took out a big gold watch with a diamondtriangle on the lid, rang eleven times, and said:     'Eleven. And for exactly an  hour I've been waiting for you to wake up,since you  made an appointment for me to come  to your  place at ten. Here Iam!'[2]     Styopa  felt for his  trousers  on the chair beside his bed,whispered:'Excuse me .  . .', put them on,  and asked  hoarsely: 'Tell me  your  name,please?'     He had difficulty speaking. At  each word,  someone stuck a needle intohis brain, causing infernal pain.     'What! You've forgotten my name, too?' Here the unknown man smiled.     'Forgive  me  ...'  Styopa  croaked,  feeling  that  his  hangover  hadpresented him with a new symptom: it seemed to him that the floor beside hisbed went away, and that at any moment he would go flying down to the devil'sdam in the nether world.     'My  dear Stepan  Bogdanovich,' the visitor said,  with a perspicacioussmile, 'no aspirin will  help you. Follow the wise old rule - cure like withlike. The only thing  that  will  bring  you back to life is two glasses  ofvodka with something pickled and hot to go with it.'     Styopa was a shrewd man and, sick as he was, realized that since he hadbeen found in this state, he would have to confess everything.     'Frankly  speaking,'  he began, his  tongue barely moving, 'yesterday Igot abit...'     'Not a word more!' the visitor answered and drew aside with his chair.     Styopa,  rolling his  eyes, saw that  a  tray had been set on  a  smalltable, on which  tray  there were  sliced white bread, pressed  caviar  in alittle bowl, pickled mushrooms on a dish,  something  in  a  saucepan,  and,finally, vodka in  a roomy decanter belonging to  the  jeweller's wife. Whatstruck  Styopa especially was that the decanter  was frosty with cold. This,however, was  understandable: it was sitting in  a bowl packed with ice.  Inshort, the service was neat, efficient.     The  stranger did not allow  Styopa's amazement to develop  to a morbiddegree, but deftly poured him half a glass of vodka.     'And you?' Styopa squeaked.     'With pleasure!'     His  hand twitching,  Styopa brought  the  glass to his lips, while thestranger swallowed the contents of his glass at one gulp. Chewing a lump  ofcaviar, Styopa squeezed out of himself the words:     'And you ... a bite of something?'     'Much  obliged, but  Inever snack,' the  stranger replied  and  pouredseconds. The saucepan was opened and found to contain frankfurters in tomatosauce.     And then the accursed green haze before his eyes dissolved,  the  wordsbegan to come out clearly, and, above all, Styopa remembered a thing or two.Namely, that it  had taken place yesterday in Skhodnya, at the dacha of  thesketch-writer  Khustov,  to which this same Khustov  had  taken  Styopa in ataxi. There was even a memory of having hired this taxi by the Metropol, andthere  was also  some  actor, or not an actor . .  . with a gramophone in  alittle  suitcase.  Yes,  yes,  yes, it  was  at  the  dacha!  The  dogs,  heremembered, had howled from this gramophone. Only the lady Styopa had wantedto kiss remained unexplained ... devil  knows who she was . .. maybe she wasin radio, maybe not. . .     The previous day  was thus coming gradually into focus,  but  right nowStyopa  was much more  interested in today's  day and,  particularly, in theappearance  in his bedroom of a stranger,and  with hors d'oeuvres and vodkato boot. It would be nice to explain that!     'Well, I hope by now you've remembered my name?'     But Styopa only smiled bashfully and spread his arms.     'Really! I get the feeling that you followed the vodka with port  wine!Good heavens, it simply isn't done!'     'I beg you to keep it between us,' Styopa said fawningly.     'Oh, of course, of course! But as for Khustov, needless to say, I can'tvouch for him.'     'So you know Khustov?'     "Yesterday, in your office, I  saw this individuum briefly, but it onlytakes a fleeting  glance at his face to  understand that he is a  bastard, asquabbler, a trimmer and a toady.'     'Perfectly  true!' thought  Styopa, struck by such a true,  precise andsuccinct definition of Khustov.     Yes,  the previous  day was  piecing itself  together,  but,  even  so,anxiety  would not take leave of the director  of the Variety. The thing wasthat  a  huge black  hole  yawned in  this  previous day. Say what you will,Styopa  simply  had not seen  this  stranger  in  the  beret in  his officeyesterday.     'Professor of  black  magic  Woland,'[3]  the  visitor  saidweightily, seeing Styopa's difficulty, and he recounted everything in order.     Yesterday afternoon he arrived in Moscow from abroad,  went immediatelyto Styopa, and offered his show to the Variety. Styopa telephoned the MoscowRegional  Entertainment  Commission  and  had the question  approved (Styopaturned pale and  blinked), then signed a contract  with Professor Woland forseven  performances  (Styopa  opened  his  mouth),  and arranged that Wolandshould come the next  morning at ten  o'clock to work out the  details . . .And  so Woland  came. Having come, he was met by the housekeeper Grunya, whoexplained that she had just come herself,  that she was  not a live-in maid,that  Berlioz was not home, and  that if  the visitor wished to  see  StepanBogdanovich, he  should  go to  his bedroom  himself. Stepan Bogdanovich wassuch a  sound sleeper that she  would not undertake to wakehim  up.  Seeingwhat condition Stepan  Bogdanovich  was in, the  artiste sent Grunya  to thenearest grocery store for  vodka and hors  d'oeuvres,  to the druggist's forice, and . . .     'Allow  me  to  reimburse you,' the mortified Styopa squealed and beganhunting for his wallet.     'Oh,  what  nonsense!' the  guest performer exclaimed and would hear nomore of it.     And so, the  vodka and hors  d'oeuvres got explained,  but all the sameStyopa was a pity to see: he remembered decidedly nothing about the contractand, on his life, had not  seen this Woland yesterday. Yes, Khustov had beenthere, but not Woland.     'May I have a look at the contract?' Styopa asked quietly.     'Please do, please do ...'     Styopa looked at the paper and froze. Everything was in place: first ofall, Styopa's own dashing signature ... aslant the margin a note in the handof  the  findirector[4]  Rimsky  authorizing  the payment of  tenthousand  roubles  to  the artiste Woland,  as an advance on the thirty-fivethousand  roubles due him for  seven  performances. What's  more,  Woland'ssignature was right there attesting to his receipt of the ten thousand!     'What  is all  this?!' the wretched Styopa thought, his head  spinning.Was  he starting to  have  ominous gaps  of memory? Well,  it  went  withoutsaying, once the  contract had  been  produced, any  further expressions  ofsurprise would  simply  be indecent.  Styopa  asked  his visitor's  leave toabsent  himself for a moment  and, just as he was, in his stocking feet, ranto the  front hall  for  the  telephone. On his  way he  called out  in  thedirection of the kitchen:     'Grunya!'     But no one responded. He  glanced at the door to Berlioz's study, whichwas next to the front hall, and here he was,  as they say, flabbergasted. Onthe door-handle he made out an enormous wax seal[5] on a string.     'Hel-lo!'  someone barked in Styopa's head. 'Just what we  needed!' Andhere Styopa's thoughts began  running on twin tracks, but, as always happensin times of catastrophe, in  the same directionand, generally,  devil knowswhere. It  is even difficult to  convey the  porridge in Styopa's head. Herewas this devilry with the black beret, the chilled vodka, and the incrediblecontract . . . And along with all that, if you please, a seal on the door aswell! That is, tell anyone you like that  Berlioz has been up  to no good --no one will believe it, by  Jove, no one will believe  it! Yet look, there'sthe seal! Yes, sir...     And here  some most  disagreeable  little thoughts  began  stirring  inStyopa's brain, about  the  article  which, as  luck would  have it,  he hadrecently inflicted on Mikhail Alexandrovich for  publication in his journal.The article, just between us, was idiotic! And worthless. And  the money wasso little . . .     Immediately after the recollection of the  article, there came flying arecollection of some dubious conversation that had taken place, he recalled,on the twenty-fourth  of  April, in the evening,  right there in  the diningroom, while Styopa was having dinner with MikhailAlexandrovich. That is, ofcourse, this conversation  could not have been  called dubious in  the  fullsense of the word (Styopa would not have ventured upon such a conversation),but it  was  on  some unnecessary  subject.  He  had been quite  free,  dearcitizens,  not  to  begin  it.  Before  the  seal,  this  conversation wouldundoubtedly have been considered  a perfect trifle, but now, after the seal...     'Ah, Berlioz, Berlioz!' boiled up in Styopa's head. This is simply  toomuch for one head!'     But it  would not do to grieve too  long, and Styopa dialled the numberof the office  of the  Variety's  findirector, Rimsky. Styopa's position wasticklish: first, the foreigner might get offended  that  Styopa was checkingon  him  after  the  contract  had  been shown, and  then  to  talk with thefindirector was also exceedingly difficult. Indeed, he could  not  just  askhim  like that: 'Tell  me, did I  sign a  contract for  thirty-five thousandroubles yesterday  with a professor of  black magic?' It was  no goodaskinglike that!     'Yes!' Rimsky's sharp, unpleasant voice came from the receiver.     'Hello,  Grigory  Danilovich,'  Styopa  began  speaking  quiedy,  'it'sLikhodeev. There's a certain matter ... hm ... hm ... I have this .. . er ... artiste Woland sitting here ...  So you see ... I wanted to ask, how aboutthis evening? . . .'     'Ah, the black magician?' Rimsky's voice responded in the receiver. Theposters will be ready shortly.'     'Uh-huh . . .' Styopa said in a weak voice, 'well, 'bye .. .'     'And you'll be coming in soon?' Rimsky asked.     'In half an hour,' Styopa replied and, hanging up the receiver, pressedhis hot  head in his hands. Ah, what a nasty thing to have happen! What  waswrong with his memory, citizens? Eh?     However, to go on  lingering in the front hall  was awkward, and Styopaformed  a  plan  straight  away: by  all  means  to  conceal  his incredibleforgetfulness, and now, first off, contrive  to  get  out  of the  foreignerwhat, in fact, he intended  to  show that  evening  inthe Variety, of whichStyopa was in charge.     Here  Styopa turned away from  the telephone  and saw  distincdy in themirror that stood in the front hall, and which the lazy Grunya had not wipedfor ages, a  certain strange specimen,  long as a pole, and in  a  pince-nez(ah, if only  Ivan Nikolaevich had been there! He would have recognized thisspecimen at once!). The  figure was reflected and  then disappeared.  Styopalooked further  down the hall in alarm and was  rocked a second time, for inthe mirror a stalwart black cat passed and also disappeared.     Styopa's heart skipped a beat, he staggered.     'What is all  this?' he  thought. 'Am I losing my mind? Where are thesereflections  coming  from?!'  He  peeked  into  the  front  hall  and  criedtimorously:     'Grunya! What's this cat doing  hanging around here?! Where did he comefrom? And the other one?!'     'Don't worry, Stepan Bogdanovich,' a voice  responded, not Grunya's butthe visitor's, from the  bedroom. The  cat is  mine.  Don't be nervous.  AndGrunyais not here, I sent her off  to  Voronezh. She complained you diddledher out of a vacation.'     These words were  so unexpected and preposterous that Styopa decided hehad not heard right. Utterly bewildered, he trotted back to the  bedroom andfroze on the threshold. His hair stood on end and small beads of sweat brokeout on his brow.     The visitor was no longer alone in the bedroom, but had company: in thesecond armchair sat the same type he  had imagined in the front hall. Now hewas  clearly visible: the  feathery  moustache,  one  lens of  the pince-nezgleaming, the other not  there. But  worse  things  were to  be found in thebedroom:  on the jeweller's wife's ottoman,  in  a  casual pose, sprawled  athird party -- namely, a black cat of uncanny size, with a glass of vodka inone  paw and a fork, on which he had managed to spear a pickled mushroom, inthe other.     The light, faint in the bedroom anyway, now began to grow quite dark inStyopa's  eyes. This is apparently how one loses one's mind ...' he  thoughtandcaught hold of the doorpost.     'I  see  you're  somewhat  surprised,  my dearest  Stepan Bogdanovich?'Woland inquired of the teeth-chattering Styopa. 'And  yet there's nothing tobe surprised at. This is my retinue.'     Here the cat tossed  off the vodka, and Styopa's hand  began  to  slidedown the doorpost.     'And this  retinue  requires room,' Woland continued,  'so there's justone too many of us in the apartment. And  it seems  to us  that this one toomany is precisely you.'     Theirself, theirself!' the long  checkered one sang in  a goat's voice,referring to Styopa in the plural. 'Generally, theirself has been up to someterrible swinishness lately. Drinking, using their position to have liaisonswith  women, don't do devil a  thing, and  can't  do  anything, because theydon't know  anything of what they're supposed to  do. Pulling  the wool overtheir superiors' eyes.'     'Availing  hisself  of a  government car!' the cat  snitched, chewing amushroom.     And here occurred the  fourth and last appearance in the apartment, asStyopa, having slid all the way to the floor, clawed at the doorpost with anenfeebled hand.     Straight  from  the  pier-glass  stepped  a  short but  extraordinarilybroad-shouldered man, with a bowler hat on his head and a fang sticking  outof  his  mouth,  which  made  still  uglier  a  physiognomy  unprecedentedlyloathsome without that. And with flaming red hair besides.     'Generally,' this  new  one  entered  into  the conversation, 'I  don'tunderstand how  he got  to  be a director,'  the redhead's nasal  twang  wasgrowing stronger and stronger, 'he's as much a director as I'm a bishop.'     "You  don't  look  like  a  bishop,  Azazello,'[6]  the  catobserved, heaping his plate with frankfurters.     That's what I mean,'  twanged  the  redhead and, turning to Woland,  headded deferentially:  'Allow me, Messire, to  chuck  him  the  devil  out ofMoscow?'     'Scat!' the cat barked suddenly, bristling his fur.     And  then  the bedroom started spinning  around Styopa, he hit hisheadagainst the doorpost, and, losing consciousness, thought: 'I'm dying...'     But he did  not die. Opening his eyes slightly, he saw  himself sittingon something made  of  stone. Around him something was making noise. When heopened his eyes properly,  he realized that the noise  was being made by thesea and, what's more, that  the waves were rocking just at his feet, that hewas, in short,  sitting  at the very  end of  a  jetty, that over him was  abrilliant blue sky and behind him a white city on the mountains.     Not  knowing how  to  behave in  such  a  case,  Styopa  got up  on histrembling legs and walked along the jetty towards the shore.     Some man was standing on the  jetty, smoking and spitting into the sea.He looked at Styopa with wild eyes and stopped spitting.     Then  Styopa  pulled  the  following stunt:  he  knelt down before  theunknown smoker and said:     'I implore you, tell me what city is this?'     "Really!' said the heartless smoker.     'I'm not drunk,'  Styopa replied hoarsely,'something's happened to  me... I'm ill ... Where am I? What city is this?'     "Well, it's Yalta . ..'     Styopa  quietly gasped and sank down on his side, his head striking thewarm stone of the jetty. Consciousness left him.
CHAPTER 8. The Combat between the Professor and the Poet        At  the  same  time  that consciousness left Styopa in  Yalta, that is,around half past  eleven in  the morning,  it  returned to Ivan  NikolaevichHomeless,  who woke  up  after a long  and  deep  sleep.  He spent some timepondering how it was that he had wound  up in an  unfamiliar room with whitewalls, with an astonishing  night table made of  some light metal,  and withwhite blinds behind which one could sense the sun.     Ivan  shook his head, ascertained that it  did not ache, and rememberedthat  he  was  in  a clinic. This thought drew  after it  the remembrance ofBerlioz's death, but today it did not provoke a strong shock in Ivan. Havinghad a good sleep, Ivan  Nikolaevich became calmer  and  began to  think moreclearly. After  lying motionless for  some time in this most clean, soft andcomfortable spring bed, Ivan noticed a bell button beside him.  From a habitof touching things needlessly, Ivan pressed it.  He expected the pressing ofthe  button  to be followed  by some  ringing  or appearance, but somethingentirely different  happened. A frosted glass cylinder with the word 'Drink'on it lit  up  at  the foot of Ivan's bed. After  pausing for a  while,  thecylinder began to rotate until the word 'Nurse'  popped out. It goes withoutsaying that the clever  cylinder amazed Ivan.  The word 'Nurse' was replacedby the words 'Call the Doctor.'     'Hm . .  .'  said  Ivan, not knowing how to proceed  further with  thiscylinder. But here he happened to be lucky. Ivan pressed the button a secondtime  at  the  word  'Attendant'.  The cylinder  rang  quietly in  response,stopped, the light went out, and a plump, sympathetic woman in a clean whitecoat came into the room and said to Ivan:     'Good morning!'     Ivan did not reply, considering such a greeting inappropriate under thecircumstances.  Indeed,  they lock up a healthy man in a clinic, and pretendthat that is how it ought to be!     The  woman  meanwhile,  without  losing  her  good-natured  expression,brought the blinds up with  one push of a button,  andsun flooded the  roomthrough  a  light and  wide-meshed grille which reached right  to the floor.Beyond  the grille  a  balcony came  into  view,  beyond that the  bank of ameandering river, and on its other bank a cheerful pine wood.     'Time for our bath,' the woman invited, and  under her hands the  innerwall parted, revealing behind it a bathroom and splendidly equipped toilet.     Ivan,  though he had resolved not to talk to the woman, could  not helphimself and, on seeing the water gush into the tub in a wide stream from thegleaming faucet, said ironically:     'Looky there! Just like the Metropol! . . .'     'Oh, no,' the woman answered proudly, 'much  better. There  is no  suchequipment even anywhere abroad.  Scientists  and doctors  come especially tostudy our clinic. We have foreign tourists every day.'     At  the words 'foreign tourists', Ivan at  once remembered  yesterday'sconsultant. Ivan darkened, looked sullen, and said:     'Foreign  tourists .. . How  you all adore foreign tourists! But  amongthem, incidentally, you come  across  all sorts. I, for  instance, met  oneyesterday -- quite something!'     And  he almost  started telling about  Pontius  Pilate, but  restrainedhimself, realizing that the woman had no use for  these stories, that in anycase she could not help him.     The  washed  Ivan  Nikolaevich  was  straight  away  issued   decidedlyeverything a man needs  after a  bath:  an ironed shirt, drawers, socks. Andnot only that: opening the door of a cupboard,  the woman pointed inside andasked:     'What would you like to put on--a dressing gown or some nice pyjamas?'     Attached to his new dwelling by force, Ivan almost clasped his hands atthe woman's casualness and silendy pointed his finger at the crimson flannelpyjamas.     After this,  Ivan  Nikolaevich was led  down  the  empty and  noiselesscorridor and brought to an  examining room of huge  dimensions. Ivan, havingdecided  to take  an  ironic attitude towards everything to be found in thiswondrously  equipped building, at once  mentally christened  this  room the'industrial kitchen'.     And with good reason. Here stood cabinets and glass cases with gleamingnickel-plated  instruments.  There  were  chairs of extraordinarily  complexconstruction, some pot-bellied  lamps with shiny shades, a myriad of phials,Bunsen burners, electric cords and appliances quite unknown to anyone.     In the examining room Ivan was taken over by three persons - two  womenand  a man  - all  in white.  First, they  led Ivan to a corner, to a littletable, with the obvious purpose of getting something or other out of him.     Ivan began to ponder the  situation. Three  ways stood before him.  Thefirst  was extremely  tempting: to  hurl  himself  at all  these  lamps  andsophisticated little things, make the devil's own wreck of them, and therebyexpress his protest at being detained  for nothing. But today's Ivan alreadydiffered  significantly  from  the Ivan  of yesterday,  and this  first  wayappeared dubious to  him: for all he knew, the thought might get  rooted  inthemthat he was a violent madman. Therefore  Ivan rejected  the first  way.There was a second: immediately to begin his  account of the  consultant andPontius  Pilate.  However,  yesterday's experience  showed  that  this storyeither  was  not believed  or was taken somehow perversely.  Therefore  Ivanrenounced this second  way as  well,  deciding  to  choose the  third  way -withdrawal into proud silence.     He  did  not  succeed  in realizing it  fully, and  had  willy-nilly toanswer, though charily and  glumly, a whole series of  questions. Thus  theygot out of Ivan decidedly everything about his  past life, down to  when andhow he  had  fallen  ill with scarlet fever fifteen  years ago. A whole pagehaving  been covered  with writing about  Ivan,  it was turned over, and thewoman  in  white went on to questions about Ivan's relatives.  Some  sort ofhumdrum started: who died when and why, and whether he drank or had venerealdisease,  and more  of the  same. In conclusion  he  was asked to tell aboutyesterday's eventsat the Patriarch's Ponds, but they did not pester him toomuch, and were not surprised at the information about Pontius Pilate.     Here the  woman yielded  Ivan up to the  man,  who went  to work on himdifferently and no longer asked  any questions.  He  took the temperature ofIvan's body, counted his pulse, looked  in Ivan's eyes,  directing some sortof lamp into them. Then the  second woman  came to the man's assistance, andthey pricked Ivan in  the back with something, but  not painfully, drew somesigns on the skin of his  chest  with  the handle of a little hammer, tappedhis knees with the hammer, which  made Ivan's  legs jump, pricked his fingerand took  his  blood,  pricked him inside  his bent elbow, put  some  rubberbracelets on his arms ...     Ivan just smiled  bitterly to himself and reflected on how stupidly andstrangely it had all happened. Just think! He had wanted to warn them all ofthe danger threatening from the unknown  consultant,  had intended  to catchhim, and all he had achieved was to windup in some mysterious room, tellingall sorts of hogwash about Uncle Fyodor, who had done some hard  drinking inVologda. Insufferably stupid!     Finally Ivan was released. He was escorted back  to  his room, where hewas given a cup of coffee, two soft-boiled eggs and white bread with butter.Having  eaten  and drunk all that was offered him, Ivan decided to  wait forwhoever was chief of this  institution,  and  from this chief to obtain bothattention for himself and justice.     And he did come,  and very soon  after Ivan's  breakfast. Unexpectedly,the door of Ivan's room opened,  and in came a lot of people in white coats.At their head walked a  man of about forty-five,  as carefully shaven  as anactor,  with  pleasant but quite  piercing eyes and  courteous  manners. Thewhole  retinue  showed him tokens of attention and respect, and his entrancetherefore came out very solemn. 'Like Pontius Pilate!' thought Ivan.     Yes, this  was unquestionably the chief.  He sat down on a stool, whileeveryone else remained standing.    'Doctor Stravinsky,' the seated man introduced himself to Ivan and gavehim a friendly look.     'Here, Alexander Nikolaevich,' someone with a trim beard  said in a lowvoice, and handed the chief Ivan's chart, all covered with writing.     They've  sewn up a whole case!' Ivan thought. And the chief ran throughthe chart with a practised eye, muttered 'Mm-hm,  mm-hm . ..', and exchangeda few phrases  with those  around  him in a  little-known  language. 'And hespeaks  Latin like Pilate,' Ivan thought sadly. Here one word made him jump;it  was  the  word 'schizophrenia' - alas,  already uttered yesterday by thecursed  foreigner  at  the  Patriarch's  Ponds,  and  now repeated today  byProfessor Stravinsky. 'And he knew that, too!' Ivan thought anxiously.     The  chief apparently  made it  a  rule to agree  with and rejoice overeverything said to him by those  around  him, and to express  this with  thewords 'Very nice, very nice ...'     'Very nice!' said Stravinsky, handing the chart back to someone, and headdressedIvan:     'You are a poet?'     'A  poet,' Ivan  replied glumly, and for  the  first time suddenly feltsome inexplicable loathing for poetry, and his own verses, coming to mind atonce, seemed to him for some reason distasteful.     Wrinkling his face, he asked Stravinsky in turn:     'You are a professor?'     To this, Stravinsky, with obliging courtesy, inclined his head.     'And you're the chief here?' Ivan continued.     Stravinsky nodded to this as well.     'I must speak with you,' Ivan Nikolaevich said meaningly.     That is what I'm here for,' returned Stravinsky.     'The thing is,' Ivan began, feeling his hour had come, 'that  I've beengot up as a madman, and nobody wants to listen to me!...'     'Oh, no, we  shall hear you out  with great attention,' Stravinsky saidseriously and  soothingly, 'and by  no means allow  you  to  be  got up as amadman.'     'Listen,  then:  yesterday  evening  I met a  mysterious person at  thePatriarch's Ponds,  maybe a  foreigner, maybe not, who knew beforehand aboutBerlioz'sdeath and has seen Pontius Pilate in person.'     The retinue listened to the poet silently and without stirring.     'Pilate? The Pilate who lived in the time  of Jesus Christ?' Stravinskyasked, narrowing his eyes at Ivan.     "The same.'     'Aha,' said Stravinsky, 'and this Berlioz died under a tram-car?'     'Precisely, he's the  one who in my presence  was killed by a  tram-caryesterday at the Ponds, and this same mysterious citizen .. .'     The  acquaintance  of  Pontius  Pilate?'  asked  Stravinsky, apparentlydistinguished by great mental alacrity.     'Precisely him,' Ivan confirmed, studying Stravinsky. 'Well, so he saidbeforehand that Annushka had  spilled the sunflower  oil ... And  he slippedright  on  that  place! How do you like that?'  Ivan inquired significantly,hoping to produce a great effect with his words.     But  the  effect  did not ensue,  and Stravinsky quite simply asked thefollowing question:     'And who is this Annushka?'     This question upset Ivan a little; his face twitched.    'Annushka  is of absolutely  no  importance  here,'  he said nervously."Devil knows who she  is. Just some  fool from Sadovaya. What's important isthat he knew  beforehand, you  see, beforehand, about the sunflower  oil! Doyou understand me?'     'Perfectly,'  Stravinsky  replied  seriously  and,  touching the poet'sknee, added: 'Don't get excited, just continue.'     To continue,' said Ivan, trying to  fall in with Stravinsky's tone, andknowing already  from bitter experience that only  calm would help him, 'so,then,  this horrible  type (and he's lying that he's a  consultant) has someextraordinary  power!  ..  .  For instance,  you chase  after him  and  it'simpossible to catch up with him . . . And  there's also  a little pair  withhim - good ones, too,  but in their own way: some long one in broken glassesand, besides  him, a  cat  of incredible size  who  rides  the  tram  all byhimself. And besides,' interrupted by no one, Ivan went on talking with everincreasing  ardour and  conviction, 'he  was personally on Pontius Pilate'sbalcony, there's  no doubt  of  it.  So  what is all this, eh?  He  must  bearrested immediately, otherwise he'll do untold harm.'     'So  you're  trying  to  get   him  arrested?  Have  I  understood  youcorrectly?' asked Stravinsky.     'He's intelligent,' thought Ivan. "You've  got  to  admit,  even  amongintellectuals you come across some of  rare intelligence, there's no denyingit,' and he replied:     'Quite  correctly! And  how  could  I not be trying,  just consider foryourself! And  meanwhile I've been  forcibly  detained here, they poke lampsinto my eyes,  give  me baths,  question me for some reason  about my  UncleFedya!  . .. And  he departed this world  long ago! I demand  to be releasedimmediately!'     'Well,  there,  very  nice,  very  nice!'  Stravinsky  responded.  'Noweverything's  clear. Really, what's the sense of  keeping a healthy man in aclinic? Very well, sir, I'll check you out of here right now, if you tell meyou're normal. Not prove, but merely tell. So, then,are you normal?'     Here complete  silence fell, and  the  fat woman who had taken  care ofIvan in  the  morning looked at the  professor  with awe. Ivan  thought onceagain: 'Positively intelligent!'     The  professor's offer pleased  him very  much, yet  before replying hethought very, very hard, wrinkling his forehead, and at last said firmly:     'I am normal.'     'Well, how very nice,'  Stravinsky exclaimed with relief, 'and  if  so,let's  reason logically. Let's  take your day yesterday.' Here he turned andIvan's chart was immediately handed to him. 'In search of an unknown man whorecommended himself as an acquaintance of Pontius Pilate,  you performed thefollowing  actions yesterday.'  Here Stravinsky began holding  up  his  longfingers, glancing now at the chart, now at Ivan. 'YOU hung a  little icon onyour chest. Did you?'     'I did,' Ivan agreed sullenly.     'YOU fell off  a  fence  and  hurt  your face. Right? Showed  up  in  arestaurant  carrying  a  burning candle in  your  hand, in  nothing butyourunderwear, and in the restaurant you  beat somebody. You  were  brought heretied up. Having come here,  you called the police and asked them to send outmachine-guns.  Then you  attempted to throw  yourself out the window. Right?The question is: can one, by acting in such fashion, catch or arrest anyone?And if  you're a normal man, you yourself will answer: by no means. You wishto leave here? Very well, sir.  But allow me  to ask, where are you going togo?'     'To the  police,  of course,'  Ivan replied,  no  longer so firmly, andsomewhat at a loss under the professor's gaze.     'Straight from here?'     'Mm-hm . . .'     'Without stopping at your place?' Stravinsky asked quickly.     'I have  no time to  stop anywhere! While I'm stopping at places, he'llslip away!'     'So. And what will you tell the police to start with?'     'About Pontius Pilate,' Ivan Nikolaevich replied, and his  eyes cloudedwith a gloomy mist.     'Well, how very nice!' the won-over  Stravinsky exclaimed  and, turningto the  one  with the  little  beard, ordered: 'Fyodor Vassilyevich, pleasecheck Citizen Homeless out for town. But don't  put anyone  in  his  room orchange the  linen. In two  hours.  Citizen Homeless will  be back here.  So,then,' he  turned  to the poet, 'I won't wish you success,  because  I don'tbelieve  one iota  in  that  success. See you soon!'  He stood up,  and  hisretinue stirred.     'On what grounds will I be back here?' Ivan asked anxiously.     Stravinsky was as if waiting  for this  question, immediately sat down,and began to speak:     'On  the grounds that as soon  as you  show up at the police station inyour  drawers and  tell them you've seen  a  man  who  knew  Pontius  Pilatepersonally, you'll instandy be brought here, and you'll find yourself  againin this very same room.'     'What have  drawers  got to do with it?' Ivan asked,  gazing around  inbewilderment.     'It's mainly Pontius Pilate. But  the drawers, too. Because  we'll takethe clinic underwear  from you and give you back your  clothes. And youweredelivered here in  your drawers. And yet vou were by no means  going to stopat  your  place, though  I  dropped you a hint. Then  comes Pilate . . . andthat's it.'     Here something strange happened with  Ivan Nikolaevich. His will seemedto crack, and he felt himself weak, in need of advice.     'What am I to do, then?' he asked, timidly this time.     "Well, how very nice!' Stravinsky replied. 'A most reasonable question.Now I am going to tell you what actually happened  to you. Yesterday someonefrightened you badly  and upset you  with  a story about Pontius Pilate  andother things. And so you,  a very nervous and high-strung man, started goingaround  the city,  telling about Pontius  Pilate.  It's quite  natural  thatyou're  taken for a madman. Your salvation  now  lies  in  just one thing  -complete peace. And you absolutely must remain here.'     'But he has to be caught!' Ivan exclaimed, imploringly now.     'Very good, sir, but why should you go running around yourself? Explainall your suspicionsand accusations against this man on paper. Nothing couldbe  simpler than to send your declaration to the proper quarters, and if, asyou  think, we are  dealing  with a  criminal,  it  will be  clarified  veryquickly. But only on one condition: don't strain your head, and try to thinkless about  Pontius Pilate. People say  all  kinds of  things!  One   mustn'tbelieve everything.'     'Understood!'  Ivan declared resolutely. 'I  ask  to  be given  pen andpaper.'     'Give him paper and a  short pencil,' Stravinsky ordered the fat woman,and to Ivan he said: 'But I don't advise you to write today.'     'No, no, today, today without fail!' Ivan cried out in alarm.     'Well, all right. Only don't  strain  your head. If it doesn't come out today, it will tomorrow.'     'He'll escape.'     'Oh, no,' Stravinsky objected confidently, 'he won't escape anywhere, Iguarantee  that. And  remember  that  here with  us you'll  be helped in allpossible  ways, and without  us nothing will  come of  it.  Do you hear me?'Stravinskysuddenly asked meaningly and took Ivan Nikolaevich by both hands.Holding them in his  own,  he repeated  for a long  time, his  eyes fixed onIvan's: 'You'll be helped here  ... do  you  hear me? .. .  You'll be helpedhere . . .  you'll get relief ... it's quiet here, all peaceful . ..  you'llbe helped here ...'     Ivan  Nikolaevich unexpectedly yawned, and  the expression on his  facesoftened.     'Yes, yes,' he said quietly.     'Well,  how  very  nice!' Stravinsky concluded  the conversation in hisusual way and stood up: 'Goodbye!' He shook Ivan's hand and, on his way out,turned to the one with the little beard and said: 'Yes, and try oxygen . . .and baths.'     A few moments later there was no Stravinsky or his retinue before Ivan.Beyond the window grille, in the noonday sun, the joyful and springtime pinewood stood beautiful on the other bank and, closer by, the river sparkled.
CHAPTER 9. Koroviev's Stunts        Nikanor Ivanovich  Bosoy, chairman of the tenants' association' of  no.302-bis on Sadovaya Street in Moscow, where the late Berlioz used to reside,had been  having the most terrible  troubles, starting from  that  Wednesdaynight.     At midnight, as we already know, a commission of which Zheldybin formeda  part came to the house, summoned  Nikanor  Ivanovich,  told him about thedeath of Berlioz, and together with him went to apartment no.50.     There the  sealing of  the deceased's  manuscripts and  belongings  wascarried out. Neither  Grunya, the daytime housekeeper,  nor the light-mindedStepan  Bogdanovich was there  at the  time.  The  commission  announced  toNikanor Ivanovich that it would take the deceased's  manuscripts for sortingout,  that his living space, that is, three  rooms (the former study, livingroom and  dining room of  the jeweller's wife), reverted to the  disposal ofthe  tenants'  association, and that  the belongings were  to be kept in theaforementioned living space untilthe heirs were announced.     The news of Berlioz's  death spread through the whole house with a sortof supernatural speed, and as of seven o'clock Thursday morning, Bosoy beganto  receive telephone  calls  and  then personal  visits  with  declarationscontaining claims  to the  deceased's living  space.  In the period  of  twohours, Nikanor Ivanovich received thirty-two such declarations.     They  contained pleas, threats,  libels, denunciations,  promises to dorenovations at their  own expense, references to unbearable overcrowding andthe impossibility of living in the same apartment with bandits. Among othersthere were  a  description, staggering  in  its artistic power, of the theftfrom  apartment  no.  51 of some meat dumplings,  tucked  directly into  thepocket of a suit jacket,  two vows to end life by suicide and one confessionof secret pregnancy.     Nikanor Ivanovich was  called out  to the front hall of  his apartment,plucked  by the sleeve, whispered to,  winked at, promised that he would notbe leftthe loser.     This torture went on until noon, when Nikanor Ivanovich simply fled hisapartment for the management office  by the gate, but when he saw them lyingin wait for him  there,  too, he  fled that  place  as well. Having  somehowshaken  off  those  who followed  on  his  heels  across  the  asphalt-pavedcourtyard, Nikanor Ivanovich disappeared into the sixth entrance and went upto the fifth floor, where this vile apartment no.50 was located.     After  catching  his  breath on   the  landing,  the  corpulent  NikanorIvanovich rang, but no one opened  for  him.  He rang again, and then again,and started  grumbling  and swearing quietly. Even then no  one  opened. Hispatience  exhausted,  Nikanor  Ivanovich  took from his  pocket a  bunch  ofduplicate keys belonging to the  house management,  opened the  door  with asovereign hand, and went in.     'Hey,  housekeeper!' Nikanor  Ivanovich  cried in  the  semi-dark fronthall. 'Grunya, or whatever your name is! ... Are you here?'     No one responded.     ThenNikanor Ivanovich took a folding ruler from his briefcase, removedthe seal from the  door  to the study, and stepped in. Stepped  in, yes, buthalted in amazement in the doorway and even gave a start.     At the deceased's desk sat an unknown, skinny, long citizen in a littlecheckered jacket, a jockey's cap, and a pince-nez . . . well, in short, thatsame one.     'And who might you be, citizen?' Nikanor Ivanovich asked fearfully.     'Hah! Nikanor Ivanovich!' the unexpected citizen yelled in  a  rattlingtenor  and,  jumping  up,  greeted  the  chairman  with a forced  and suddenhandshake. This greeting by no means gladdened Nikanor Ivanovich.     'Excuse me,' he said suspiciously,  'but who might you be? Are  you  anofficial person?'     'Eh, Nikanor Ivanovich!' the unknown man exclaimed soulfully. "What areofficial and unofficial persons? It all depends on your point of view on thesubject. It's all fluctuating and relative, Nikanor Ivanovich.  Today I'm anunofficial  person, and tomorrow, lo and behold, I'man official one! And italso happens the other way round -- oh, how it does!'     This argument in no way satisfied the chairman of the house management.Being a generally suspicious person by  nature, he  concluded  that the  manholding forth in  front  of  him was  precisely  an  unofficial person,  andperhaps even an idle one.     "fes,  but who might you be?  What's  your name?' the chairman inquiredwith increasing severity and even began to advance upon the unknown man.     'My  name,'  the citizen responded, not  a bit put out by the severity,'well,  let's say it's  Koroviev.  But wouldn't you  like  a  little  snack,Nikanor Ivanovich? No formalities, eh?'     'Excuse  me,'  Nikanor  Ivanovich began, indignantly  now,  Svhat  havesnacks  got to  do  with it!' (We must  confess, unpleasant as  it  is, thatNikanor Ivanovich was of a somewhat rude nature.) 'Sitting in the deceased'shalf is not permitted! What are you doing here?'     'Have  a seat, Nikanor Ivanovich,' the citizen  went on yelling,  not abitat a loss, and began fussing about offering the chairman a seat.     Utterly infuriated, Nikanor Ivanovich rejected the seat and screamed:     'But who are you?'     'I, if you please,  serve as interpreter for a  foreign individual  whohas taken up residence  in this apartment,' the man calling himself Korovievintroduced himself and clicked the heels of his scuffed, unpolished shoes.     Nikanor Ivanovich opened his mouth. The presence of  some  foreigner inthis apartment, with an interpreter to boot, came  as a complete surprise tohim, and he demanded explanations.     The interpreter explained willingly. A foreign artiste, Mr Woland,  hadbeen kindly  invited  by the  director  of  the  Variety, Stepan BogdanovichLikhodeev, to  spend  the  time of his  performances, a week  or so, in  hisapartment, about  which  he  had  written  to  Nikanor Ivanovich  yesterday,requesting  that  he register  the foreigner  as a temporary resident, whileUkhodeev himself took a trip to Yalta.     'He never wrote me anything,'the chairman said in amazement.     'Just  look   through  your  briefcase,  Nikanor  Ivanovich,'  Korovievsuggested sweetly.     Nikanor  Ivanovich, shrugging his shoulders,  opened the  briefcase andfound Likhodeev's letter in it.     'How  could I have forgotten about  it?'  Nikanor  Ivanovich  muttered,looking dully at the opened envelope.     'All  sorts of things  happen, Nikanor Ivanovich, all  sorts!' Korovievrattled.  'Absent-mindedness,  absent-mindedness,  fatigue  and  high  bloodpressure,  my  dear  friend Nikanor  Ivanovich! I'm  terribly  absent-mindedmyself! Someday, over a glass, I'll tell you a few facts from my biography -you'll die laughing!'     'And when is Likhodeev going to Yalta?'     'He's  already  gone,  gone!'  the  interpreter  cried.  'He's  alreadywheeling along,  you know!  He's already  devil  knows where!'  And here theinterpreter waved his arms like the wings of a windmill.     Nikanor Ivanovich declared  that he must see  the foreigner in  person,but got a refusal on that fromthe interpreter: quite impossible. He's busy.Training the cat.     'The cat I can show you, if you like,' Koroviev offered.     This  Nikanor  Ivanovich  refused  in  his turn,  and  the  interpreterstraight  away  made  the  chairman  an  unexpected  but  quite  interestingproposal: seeing that Mr Woland had no desire whatsoever to live in a hotel,and was accustomed to having  a lot of  space,  why shouldn't  the  tenants'association  rent to  him, Woland,  for one  little week,  the  time of  hisperformances in Moscow,  the whole of the apartment, that is, the deceased'srooms as well?     'It's all the same  to  him - the deceased  - you must  agree,  NikanorIvanovich,' Koroviev whispered hoarsely. 'He doesn't need the apartment now,does he?'     Nikanor Ivanovich, somewhat perplexed, objected that  foreigners  oughtto live at the Metropol, and not in private apartments at all...     'I'm  telling  you,  he's  capricious as  devil  knows  what!' Korovievwhispered.  'He just doesn't want to! He doesn't like hotels! I've had themup to  here,  these foreign  tourists!' Koroviev  complained confidentially,jabbing his  finger  at his sinewy neck.  'Believe me,  they wring the  soulright  out of you! They come and either spy on you like the lowest son  of abitch,  or else  torment you with their caprices - this isn't right and thatisn't right! . . . And for your association, Nikanor Ivanovich, it's a sheergain and an obvious profit. He won't stint on money.' Koroviev looked aroundand then whispered into the chairman's ear: 'A millionaire!'     The interpreter's offer made clear practical sense, it was a very solidoffer, yet there was something remarkably unsolid in his manner of speaking,and in his clothes, and in that loathsome, good-for-nothing pince-nez.  As aresult, something  vague weighed on the chairman's soul, but he neverthelessdecided  to accept  the  offer. The thing was that the tenants' association,alas,  had quite a sizeable deficit. Fuel had to  be bought  for the heatingsystem by fall, but who was going to shellout for it --  no  one  knew. Butwith the foreign tourist's money, it might be possible to wriggle out of it.However, the practical  and prudent  Nikanor Ivanovich said  he  would firsthave to settle the question with the foreign tourist bureau.     'I  understand!'  Koroviev   cried   out.  'You've  got  to  setde  it!Absolutely! Here's the telephone, Nikanor  Ivanovich, settle it at once! Anddon't be shy about the money,'  he added in a whisper, drawing  the chairmanto the telephone in the front hall, 'if he won't  pay, who will! You  shouldsee  the villa  he's  got  in Nice!  Next  summer, when you  go abroad, comeespecially to see it -- you'll gasp!'     The business with  the  foreign  tourist bureau  was  arranged over thephone with an extraordinary speed, quite amazing  to the chairman. It turnedout  that they  already  knew about  Mr  Woland's  intention  of staying  inLikhodeev's private apartment and had no objections to it.     'That's  wonderful!' Koroviev yelled. Somewhat stunned by  his chatter,the chairman  announced  that  the  tenants'  association  agreed  to  rentapartment no.50 for a week to the artiste Woland, for ...  Nikanor Ivanovichfaltered a little, then said:     'For five hundred roubles a day.'     Here  Koroviev  utterly  amazed the chairman. Winking thievishly in thedirection of the bedroom, from which the soft leaps of a heavy cat could  beheard, he rasped out:     'So it comes to three thousand five hundred for the week?'     To which Nikanor Ivanovich thought he was going to  add: 'Some appetiteyou've got, Nikanor Ivanovich!' but Koroviev said something quite different:     'What kind of money is that? Ask five, he'll pay it.'     Grinning perplexedly, Nikanor Ivanovich,  without noticing  how,  foundhimself  at the deceased's writing desk, where Koroviev with great speed anddexterity drew up a contract in two copies. Then he flew to the bedroom withthem  and  came  back,  both  copies now  bearing  the  foreigner's sweepingsignature. The chairman also signed the contract. Here Korovievasked  for areceipt for five . ..     Write it out, write it out, Nikanor Ivanovich! ... thousand roubles . ..'  And with words somehow unsuited to serious business --'Bin, zwei, drei!'-- he laid out for the chairman five stacks of new banknotes.     The counting-up  took  place, interspersed  with  Koroviev's quips  andquiddities,  such as 'Cash loves counting', 'Your own  eye won't  lie',  andothers of the same sort.     After  counting  the  money,  the chairman  received  from Koroviev theforeigner's  passport for temporary registration, put it, together with  thecontract and  the money,  into his briefcase, and,  somehow unable  to  helphimself, sheepishly asked for a free pass ...     'Don't mention it!' bellowed Koroviev.  'How many  tickets do you want,Nikanor Ivanovich -- twelve, fifteen?'     The flabbergasted chairman explained that all he needed was a couple ofpasses, for himself and Pelageya Antonovna, his wife.     Koroviev  snatched out a notebook at  once  and  dashed  off a pass forNikanor Ivanovich,for two persons in the front row. And with his  left handthe  interpreter deftly slipped  this pass to Nikanor  Ivanovich, while withhis  right he  put into the chairman's other hand  a  thick,  crackling wad.Casting  an eye on it, Nikanor Ivanovich blushed deeply and began to push itaway.     'It isn't done . . .' he murmured.     'I won't  hear of it,' Koroviev whispered right  in his  ear.  'With usit's  not  done,  but  with foreigners it is.  You'll  offend  him,  NikanorIvanovich, and that's embarrassing. You've worked hard . ..'     'It's  severely punishable,' the chairman  whispered very, very  softlyand glanced over his shoulder.     'But where are the witnesses?'  Koroviev whispered into  his other ear.'I ask you, where are they? You don't think . .. ?'     Here,  as the chairman insisted afterwards, a miracle occurred: the wadcrept into his briefcase by  itself. And then the chairman, somehow limp andeven  broken, found himself on the stairs. A whirlwind  of thoughts raged inhis head. There was thevilla in Nice,  and the trained cat, and the thoughtthat there were  in  fact no witnesses, and that Pelageya Antonovna would bedelighted  with  the  pass. They  were incoherent  thoughts,  but  generallypleasant. But, all the same, somewhere, some little needle kept pricking thechairman in the very  bottom of  his  soul.  This was  the needle of anxiety.Besides, right then on the stairs the chairman was seized, as with a stroke,by the thought: 'But how did the interpreter  get into the study if the doorwas sealed?! And how was it that he, Nikanor  Ivanovich, had not asked aboutit?' For some time  the chairman stood staring like a  sheep at the steps ofthe stairway, but then he decided to spit on it and not torment himself withintricate questions . . .     As soon as the chairman  left the  apartment, a low voice came from thebedroom:     'I didn't like this Nikanor Ivanovich. He  is  a chiseller and a crook.Can it be arranged so that he doesn't come any more?'     'Messire, you have only  to say the word ...' Koroviev responded  fromsomewhere, not in a rattling but in a very clear and resounding voice.     And  at once  the accursed  interpreter turned  up in the  front  hall,dialled a  number there, and  for some reason began speaking  very tearfullyinto the receiver:     'Hello! I consider it my duty  to  inform you that the chairman  of ourtenants' association at no.502-bis on Sadovaya, Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy,  isspeculating in foreign currency.[2] At the present moment, in hisapartment no. 55, he has four hundred dollars wrapped up in newspaper in theventilation of the privy. This is Timofei Kvastsov speaking, a tenant of thesaid house, apartment no. 11.  But I adjure you to keep my name  a secret. Ifear the vengeance of the above-stated chairman.'     And he hung up, the scoundrel!     What happened next  in apartment no.50  is  not known, but it is  knownwhat  happened  at Nikanor Ivanovich's. Having  locked  himself in the privywith the  hook,  he took  from his briefcase  the wad foisted  on him by theinterpreterand  satisfied himself that it  contained  four hundred roubles.Nikanor Ivanovich wrapped this  wad in a scrap  of newspaper and put it intothe ventilation duct.     Five minutes later the chairman was sitting  at the table  in his smalldining  room.  His wife  brought  pickled herring from  the kitchen,  neatlysliced  and  thickly  sprinkled  with green onion.  Nikanor Ivanovich pouredhimself a dram of vodka, drank it, poured another, drank it, picked up threepieces of herring  on his fork .  . . and at that moment the doorbell  rang.Pelageya Antonovna was just bringing in a steaming pot which, one could tellat once from a single glance,  contained, amidst a  fiery borscht, that thanwhich there is nothing more delicious in the world - a marrow bone.     Swallowing his spittle, Nikanor Ivanovich growled like a dog:     'Damn them all! Won't  allow a man to  eat ... Don't let anyone in, I'mnot  here,  not  here ...  If it's about the  apartment,  tell them  to stopblathering, there'll be a meeting next week.'    His wife ran to the front hall, while Nikanor Ivanovich, using a ladle,drew from the fire-breathing  lake -- it, the  bone, cracked lengthwise. Andat that moment two citizens entered the dining room, with Pelageya Antonovnafollowing  them, for  some reason looking  very pale.  Seeing  the citizens,Nikanor Ivanovich also turned white and stood up.     'Where's the Jakes?' the first  one,  in  a white side-buttoned  shirt,asked with a preoccupied air.     Something thudded against the dining table (this was  Nikanor Ivanovichdropping the ladle on to the oilcloth).     'This way, this way,' Pelageya Antonovna replied in a patter.     And the visitors immediately hastened to the corridor.     ^What's  the  matter?' Nikanor Ivanovich asked quiedy, going  after thevisitors. 'There  can't be anything like  that in our apartment .  .. And --your papers . . . begging your pardon . . .'     The first, without stopping, showed Nikanor Ivanovich a paper,  and thesecond  was  at the same moment standing on a stool in the privy,his arm inthe ventilation duct. Everything went dark in Nikanor Ivano-vich's eyes. Thenewspaper was  removed, but  in the  wad  there  were not roubles  but  someunknown money, bluish-greenish,  and  with the portrait  of  some  old  man.However, Nikanor Ivanovich saw it all dimly,  there were some sort  of spotsfloating in front of his eyes.     'Dollars in the ventilation  . . .' the  first said pensively and askedNikanor Ivanovich gently and courteously: 'Your little wad?'     'No!' Nikanor Ivanovich replied in a dreadful  voice. 'Enemies stuck mewith it!'     'That happens,' the first agreed and added, again gendy:  'Well, you'regoing to have to turn in the rest.'     'I haven't got any! I swear to God,  I never laid a finger  on it!' thechairman cried out desperately.     He dashed to the chest, pulled a drawer out with a clatter, and from itthe briefcase, crying out incoherently:     'Here's the contract... that vermin of an interpreter  stuck me with it... Koroviev ... in a pince-nez! ...'     He openedthe briefcase, glanced into it, put  a hand inside, went bluein the face,  and dropped the briefcase into the borscht.  There was nothingin  the  briefcase: no letter  from  Styopa,  no  contract,  no  foreigner'spassport,  no money, no theatre  pass.  In short, nothing except  a  foldingruler.     'Comrades!'  the  chairman  cried frenziedly.  'Catch  them! There  areunclean powers in our house!'     It is not known what Pelageya Antonovna imagined here, only she claspedher hands and cried:     'Repent, Ivanych! You'll get off lighter.'     His  eyes bloodshot, Nikanor Ivanovich raised his fists over his wife'shead, croaking:     'Ohh, you damned fool!'     Here he  went slack and  sank down  on  a chair,  evidendy resolved  tosubmit to the inevitable.     During this time, Timofei  Kondratievich Kvastsov stood on the landing,placing  now  his ear,  now his  eye to the  keyhole  of  the  door  to  thechairman's apartment, melting with curiosity.     Five  minutes later the tenants of the house  who were in thecourtyardsaw the chairman, accompanied by two other persons,  proceed directly to thegates  of  the house. It  was  said  that  Nikanor  Ivanovich looked  awful,staggered like a drunk man as he passed, and was muttering something.     And an hour after that an unknown citizen appeared in apartment no. 11,just as Timofei Kondratievich, spluttering  with delight,  was telling  someother   tenants  how   the  chairman   got  pinched,  motioned  to   TimofeiKondratievich  with his finger  to come from the kitchen  to the front hall,said something to him, and together they vanished.
CHAPTER 10. News From Yalta        At the same rime that  disaster struck. Nikanor Ivanovich, not far awayfrom no.502-bis, on the same Sadovaya Street, in the office of the financialdirector of the  Variety Theatre, Rimsky, there sat two men: Rimsky himself,and the administrator of the Variety, Varenukha.'     The big office  on the second floor of  the theatre  had two windows onSadovaya and one, just  behind the back  of the findirector, who was sittingat his  desk,  facing  the  summer garden of  the  Variety, where there wererefreshment   stands,  a  shooting  gallery  and  an  open-air  stage.   Thefurnishings of the office, apart from the desk, consisted  of a bunch of oldposters  hanging on the  wall, a small  table with  a carafe of water on it,four  armchairs and, in the corner, a  stand  on which stood  a dust-coveredscale model  of some  past review. Well,  it  goes without  saying  that, inaddition, there  was  in the office a small, shabby, peeling fireproof safe,to Rimsky's left, next to the desk.     Rimsky, now sittingat his desk, had been in bad spirits since morning,while Varenukha, on  the contrary,  was very animated and somehow especiallyrestlessly active. Yet there was no outlet for his energy.     Varenukha was presently  hiding in. the findirector's office to  escapethe seekers of free passes, who  poisoned  his life, especially on days whenthe programme changed.  And today  was  precisely such a day. As soon as thetelephone started to' ring,  Varenukha would  pick up the receiver  and  lieinto it:     "Who? Varenukha? He's not here. He stepped out.' 'Please call Likhodeevagain,' Rimsky asked vexedly. 'He's not home. I even sent Karpov, there's noone  in  the  apartment.'  'Devil  knows what's going on!'  Rimisky  hissed,clacking on the adding machine.     The  door opened  and an  usher dragged  in  a  thick stack of  freshlyprinted extra posters; in big red letters on a green background was printed:     Today and Every Day at the Variety Theatre     an Additional Programme     PROFESSOR WOLAND     Seances of BlackMagic and its Full Exposure     Varenukha stepped back from  the poster, which he had thrown  on to thescale model, admired it, and told  the  usher  to send  all the  posters outimmediately to be pasted up.     'Good . . . Loud!' Varenukha observed on the usher's departure.     'And  I  dislike this undertaking extremely,' Rimsky grumbled, glancingspitefully at the poster through his horn-rimmed glasses, 'and generally I'msurprised he's been allowed to present it.'     'No, Grigory Danilovich, don't say so! This  is  a very subde step. Thesalt is all in the exposure.'     'I  don't know,  I  don't know, there's no salt, in my opinion  ... andhe's always coming  up with  things like this! ... He might at least show ushis magician! Have you seen him? Where he dug him up, devil knows!'     It turned out  that Varenukha had not seen  the  magician any more thanRimsky had. Yesterday Styopa  had  come running  ('like crazy',  in Rimsky'sexpression) to the findirector with the already written draft of a contract,orderedit copied straight away  and  the  money handed  over to Woland. Andthis  magician  had cleared  out,  and no  one had seen  him  except  Styopahimself.     Rimsky took out his  watch, saw that it read five minutes past two, andflew into  a complete  rage. Really! Likhodeev had  called at around eleven,said  he'd come  in  half an  hour,  and  not  only  had  not come, but  haddisappeared from his apartment.     'He's holding up my  business!' Rimsky  was  roaring  now,  jabbing hisfinger at a pile of unsigned papers.     'Might he have fallen under a tram-car like Berlioz?' Varenukha said ashe held his ear to the  receiver, from which came low, prolonged and utterlyhopeless signals.     "Wouldn't be a bad  thing  ...' Rimsky said barely  audibly through histeeth.     At that same moment a  woman  in a uniform  jacket, visored cap,  blackskirt and sneakers came  into the office. From a small pouch at her belt thewoman took a small white square and a notebook and asked:     "Who  here is Variety?  A super-lightningtelegram.[2]  Signhere.'     Varenukha scribbled some flourish in the woman's notebook, and  as soonas  the door slammed behind  her, he  opened  the square. After  reading thetelegram, he blinked and handed the square to Rimsky.     The  telegram contained the following: 'Yalta  to Moscow Variety. Todayeleven  thirty  brown-haired  man  came  criminal  investigation  nightshirttrousers shoeless  mental  case gave  name Likhodeev Director  Variety  WireYalta criminal investigation where Director Likhodeev.'     'Hello  and how  do  you  do!'  Rimsky exclaimed, and  added:  'Anothersurprise!'     'A false Dmitri!'[3] said Varenukha,  and he spoke into  thereceiver.  Telegraph   office?  Variety  account.   Take  a  super-lightningtelegram.  Are  you  listening?  "Yalta  criminal  investigation.   Director Likhodeev Moscow Findirector Rimsky."'     Irrespective  of  the news  about  the  Yalta impostor, Varenukha againbegan searching all over for Styopa by telephone, and naturally did not findhim anywhere.    Just as Varenukha,  receiver in hand, was pondering where else he mightcall, the same  woman who had brought the first telegram came  in and handedVarenukha a  new envelope. Opening it hurriedly, Varenukha read the  messageand whistled.     'What now?' Rimsky asked, twitching nervously.     Varenukha  silently  handed  him the  telegram, and the findirector sawthere the words: 'Beg  believe thrown  Yalta  Woland hypnosis  wire criminalinvestigation confirm identity Likhodeev.'     Rimsky  and Varenukha, their  heads touching, reread  the telegram, andafter rereading it, silently stared at each other.     'Citizens!' the woman got angry.  'Sign, and then be  silent as much asyou like! I deliver lightnings!'     Varenukha, without taking his eyes  off the  telegram,  made  a crookedscrawl in the notebook, and the woman vanished.     'Didn't you talk with him on  the phone at a little past  eleven?'  theadministrator began in total bewilderment.     'No, it's  ridiculous!' Rimsky cried shrilly. Talk or  not, he can'tbein Yalta now! It's ridiculous!'     'He's drunk . . .' said Varenukha.     "Who's drunk?' asked Rimsky, and again the two stared at each other.     That some  impostor or madman had  sent telegrams from Yalta, there wasno doubt. But the  strange thing was this:  how did the Yalta mystifier knowWoland,  who had come to Moscow  just the  day before? How did he know aboutthe connection between Likhodeev and Woland?     'Hypnosis  ..  .' Varenukha kept repeating the  word from the telegram.'How does he  know  about  Woland?' He blinked  his eyes  and suddenly criedresolutely: 'Ah, no! Nonsense! . .. Nonsense, nonsense!'     'Where's he staying, this Woland, devil take him?' asked Rimsky.     Varenukha  immediately got  connected with the  foreign tourist  bureauand, to Rimsky's utter  astonishment, announced  that  Woland was staying inLikhodeev's apartment.  Dialling the number of the Likhodeev apartment afterthat, Varenukha listened for a long time to the low buzzing in the receiver.Amidst the  buzzing,  fromsomewhere far away, came  a  heavy, gloomy  voicesinging: '..  . rocks, my refuge  .. .'[4]  and Varenukha decidedthat the telephone lines had crossed with a voice from a radio show.     The  apartment  doesn't  answer,'  Varenukha  said,  putting  down  thereceiver, 'or maybe I should call...'     He  did not finish. The same  woman appeared in the door, and both men,Rimsky and Varenukha,  rose to meet her, while she took from her pouch not awhite sheet this time, but some sort of dark one.     This  is  beginning  to  get interesting,'  Varenukha said through  histeeth,  his eyes following the  hurriedly  departing  woman.  Rimsky was thefirst to take hold of the sheet.     On  a dark  background of  photographic  paper,  some black handwrittenlines were barely discernible:     'Proof my  handwriting  my signature  wire urgendy  confirmation  placesecret watch Woland Likhodeev.'     In his twenty  years  of  work in the  theatre, Varenukha had seen  allkinds of sights, but here he felt his mind becoming obscuredas with a veil,and he could find nothing to say but the at once mundane and  utterly absurdphrase:     This cannot be!'     Rimsky acted otherwise. He stood up, opened the door, barked out to themessenger girl sitting on a stool:     'Let no one in except postmen!' - and locked the door with a key.     Then he took a pile of papers  out of the desk  and began carefully  tocompare the bold, back-slanting letters of the photogram with the letters inStyopa's resolutions and  signatures,  furnished  with a corkscrew flourish.Varenukha,  leaning his weight  on the table,  breathed  hotly  on  Rimsky'scheek.     'It's  his  handwriting,'  the  findirector finally  said  firmly,  andVarenukha repeated like an echo:     'His.'     Peering  into Rimsky's face, the administrator marvelled at  the changethat had come over  this face. Thin to begin with, the findirector seemed tohave grown still thinner and even older, hi[6] eyes in their hornrims  had lost their  customary prickliness, and there appeared in  them notonlyalarm, but even sorrow.     Varenukha did everything  that a man in a moment of  great astonishmentought to do. He raced  up and down the office, he raised his arms twice likeone crucified, he drank a whole glass of yellowish water from the carafe andexclaimed:     'I don't understand! I don't understand! I don't un-der-stand!'     Rimsky  meanwhile was  looking  out  the  window,  thinking hard  aboutsomething. The  findirector's  position was very difficult. It was necessaryat   once,   right  on  the   spot,  to  invent  ordinary  explanations  forextraordinary phenomena.     Narrowing his eyes, the  findirector  pictured to himself  Styopa, in anightshirt and  shoeless,  getting into some  unprecedented super-high-speedairplane at around  half past eleven that morning, and then the same Styopa,also at half past eleven,  standing in  his stocking feet at the airport  inYalta . . . devil knew what to make of it!     Maybe it was not Styopa who talked with him this morning over the phonefrom his own apartment?No,  it was Styopa  speaking! Who if  not he  shouldknow Styopa's voice? And even if it was not Styopa speaking today, it was noearlier  than yesterday, towards  evening,  that Styopa  had  come  from hisoffice  to this  very office  with this idiotic  contract  and  annoyed  thefindirector with his light-mindedness. How could he have  gone or flown awaywithout leaving  word at  the  theatre? But if he  had flown away  yesterdayevening - he would not have arrived by noon today. Or would he?     'How many miles is it to Yalta?' asked Rimsky.     Varenukha stopped his running and yelled:     'I thought of  that! I  already diought of it! By train it's  over ninehundred miles to Sebastopol,  plus another fifty to Yalta! Well, but by air,of course, it's less.'     Hm . .. Yes .  .. There could be no question  of  any trains. But  whatthen? Some fighter plane?  Who would let Styopa on any fighter plane withouthis shoes? What for?  Maybe he took his shoes off when he got to Yalta? It'sthe  same thing: what for? And evenwith his shoes on they wouldn't have lethim on a fighter! And what has the fighter  got to do with  it? It's writtenthat he came to the investigators at half past eleven in the morning, and hetalked  on the telephone in Moscow. . . excuse me .. . (the face of Rimsky'swatch emerged before his eyes).     Rimsky tried to remember where the hands had been .. . Terrible! It hadbeen twenty minutes past eleven!     So  what  does it  boil  down  to?  If  one  supposes  that  after  theconversation Styopa instantly rushed to the airport, and reached it in, say,five minutes (which, incidentally, was also unthinkable), it  means mat  dieplane, taking off at once, covered nearly a thousand miles  in five minutes.Consequently, it was flying at twelve thousand miles an hour!!! That  cannotbe, and that means he's not in Yalta!     What remains, then? Hypnosis? There's no hypnosis in the world that canfling a man a  thousand miles away! So he's imagining that he's in Yalta? Hemay  be imagining it, but are the Yalta investigatorsalso imagining it? No,no, sorry, that can't be!... Yet they did telegraph from there?     The findirector's face was literally  dreadful. The door handle was allthe while being turned and pulled from outside, and the messenger girl couldbe heard through the door crying desperately:     'Impossible! I won't let you! Cut me to pieces! It's a meeting!'     Rimsky  regained  control  of himself  as  well  as he could,  took diereceiver of the phone, and said into it:     'A super-urgent call to Yalta, please.'     'Clever!' Varenukha observed mentally.     But  the conversation with Yalta did not take place. Rimsky hung up thereceiver and said:     'As luck would have it, the line's broken.'     It could be  seen that the broken  line  especially  upset him for somereason, and  even made him  lapse into diought. Having diought  a little, heagain  took die receiver in one hand, and with  the other began writing downwhat he said into it:     Take  a super-lightning. Variety.  Yes.  Yalta criminal  investigation.Yes.'Today around eleven thirty Likhodeev talked me phone Moscow stop Afterthat did not  come work unable locate by phone stop Confirm handwriting stopTaking measures watch said artiste Findirector Rimsky.'"     'Very clever!' thought Varenukha, but before he had time to think well,the words rushed through his head: 'Stupid! He can't be in Yalta!'     Rimsky  meanwhile did the following: he neatly stacked all the receivedtelegrams, plus the copy of his own, put the stack into an  envelope, sealedit, wrote a few words on it, and handed it to Varenukha, saying:     'Go     right     now,     Ivan    Savelyevich,    take    it     therepersonally.[5] Let them sort it out.'     'Now that is really clever!' thought Varenukha, and he put the envelopeinto his briefcase. Then, just in case, he dialled Styopa's apartment numberon  the  telephone, listened, and  began winking and  grimacing joyfully andmysteriously. Rimsky stretched his neck.     'May I speak with the artiste Woland?' Varenukha asked sweetly.     'Mister's busy,'  the  receiver answered in  a rattling voice,  'who'scalling?'     The administrator of the Variety, Varenukha.'     'Ivan  Savelyevich?' the receiver cried out joyfully. Terribly  glad tohear your voice! How're you doing?'     'Merci,' Varenukha replied in amazement, 'and with whom am I speaking?'     'His assistant, his assistant  and interpreter, Koroviev!' crackled thereceiver. 'I'm entirely at your service, my  dearest Ivan Savelyevich! Orderme around as you like. And so?'     'Excuse  me, but..  . what, is Stepan Bogdanovich Likhodeev not at homenow?'     'Alas, no! No!' the receiver shouted. 'He left!'     'For where?'     'Out of town, for a drive in the car.'     'Wh ... what? A dr . .. drive? And when will he be back?'     'He said, I'll get a breath of fresh air and come back.'     'So . . .' said the puzzled Varenukha, 'merci ... kindly tell  MonsieurWoland that his performance is tonight in the third part of the. programme.'     'Right. Of course. Absolutely. Urgently. Without fail.  I'll tellhim,'the receiver rapped out abruptly.     'Goodbye,' Varenukha said in astonishment.     'Please accept,'  said the  receiver,  'my best, warmest greetings  andwishes! For success! Luck! Complete happiness! Everything!'     'But of course!  Didn't I say so!' the administrator  cried agitatedly.'It's not any Yalta, he just went to the country!'     'Well, if that's so,'  the findirector began, turning  pale with anger,'it's real swinishness, there's even no name for it!'     Here the  administrator jumped up and  shouted  so that Rimsky  gave  astart:     'I  remember!  I  remember! They've opened a  new  Georgian  tavern  inPushkino called "Yalta"! It's all  clear! He went there, got  drunk, and nowhe's sending telegrams from there!'     'Well, now that's too much!' Rimsky answered,  his cheek twitching, anddeep, genuine anger burned  in  his eyes.  'Well, then,  he's  going to  paydearly for  this little  excursion! .  . .' He  suddenly  faltered and addedirresolutely: 'But what about the criminal investigation...'     'It's nonsense!  His  own  little jokes,'  the  expansive administratorinterrupted, and asked: 'Shall I take the envelope?'     'Absolutely,' replied Rimsky.     And again  the  door opened and in  came that same ..  . 'Her!' thoughtRimsky,  for some reason with  anguish.  And  both  men  rose  to  meet  thepostwoman.     This time the telegram contained the words:     Thank  you   confirmation   send   five   hundred   urgently   criminalinvestigation my name tomorrow fly Moscow Likhodeev.'     'He's lost his mind . . .' Varenukha said weakly.     Rimsky jingled his key, took money from the fireproof safe, counted outfive  hundred roubles, rang the  bell, handed the messenger  the  money, andsent him to the telegraph office.     'Good heavens, Grigory Danilovich,'  Varenukha said, not  believing hiseyes, 'in my opinion you oughtn't to send the money.'     'It'll come  back,' Rimsky replied quietly, 'but he'll have a hard timeexplaining  this little picnic.' And he added,  indicating the briefcase  toVarenukha:'Go, Ivan Savelyevich, don't delay.'     And Varenukha ran out of the office with the briefcase.     He went  down to  the ground  floor,  saw the longest  line at  the boxoffice,  found  out  from  the box-office girl that she expected to sell outwithin  the  hour, because  the  public was  simply  pouring  in  since  theadditional poster had been put up, told the girl to earmark and hold  thirtyof  the  best seats in the gallery and  the stalls,  popped out  of the  boxoffice, shook off importunate  pass-seekers as  he  ran, and  dived into hislittle office to get his cap. At that moment the telephone ratded.     'Yes!' Varenukha shouted.     'Ivan Savelyevich?' the  receiver inquired in a  most  repulsive  nasalvoice.     'He's not in the  theatre!'  Varenukha was  shouting, but  the receiverinterrupted him at once:     'Don't play the fool, Ivan Savelyevich, just listen.  Do not take thosetelegrams anywhere or show them to anyone.'     'Who is this?'  Varenukha bellowed.  'Stop these jokes, citizen! You'llbefound out at once! What's your number?'     'Varenukha,' the same nasty voice returned, 'do you understand Russian?Don't take the telegrams anywhere.'     'Ah, so  you won't stop?' the administrator cried furiously. 'Look out,then! You're going to pay  for it!'  He  shouted some other threat, but fellsilent, because he sensed that no one was listening to him any longer in thereceiver.     Here it somehow began to grow  dark very quickly in his little  office.Varenukha ran out, slammed the door behind him, and rushed through the  sideentrance into the summer garden.     The administrator was agitated and full  of energy. After  the insolentphone  call he had no  doubts that it  was a band of hooligans playing nastytricks, and  that  these tricks  were connected with  the  disappearance  ofLikhodeev.  The  administrator  was choking  with  the desire to expose  themalefactors, and, strange as it was, the anticipation of something enjoyablewas born in him. It happens that way when a man strives to become the centreofattention, to bring sensational news somewhere.     In the  garden the wind blew in the administrator's face and flung sandin his eyes, as if blocking his way, as if cautioning him.  A window on  thesecond floor slammed so that the glass nearly broke,  the tops of the maplesand  lindens  rustled   alarmingly.  It   became  darker   and  colder.  Theadministrator rubbed his  eyes and saw that a yellow-bellied storm cloud wascreeping low over Moscow. There came a dense, distant rumbling.     However great Varenukha's hurry, an irrepressible desire pulled  at himto run over to the summer  toilet for a second on his way, to check  whetherthe repairman had put a wire screen over the light-bulb.     Running past the  shooting gallery, Varenukha came to a thick growth oflilacs where  the light-blue toilet building stood. The repairman turned outto  be an efficient fellow, the bulb under the roof of the  gentlemen's sidewas covered with a wire screen, but the administrator was upset that even inthe  pre-storm  darkness one could  make  out that the  walls were  alreadywritten all over in charcoal and pencil.     'Well, what sort of. . .' the administrator began and  suddenly heard avoice purring behind him:     'Is  that you, Ivan Savelyevich?'     Varenukha started, turned around, and  saw before him  a short, fat manwith what seemed to him a cat-like physiognomy.     'So, it's me, Varenukha answered hostilely.'     'Very,  very  glad,' the cat-like fat man responded in a  squeaky voiceand, suddenly swinging his arm, gave Varenukha such a blow on  the  ear thatthe  cap flew off the administrator's head and vanished without a trace downthe hole in the seat.     At  the  fat  man's blow, the whole  toilet lit  up momentarily with  atremulous light, and a  roll of thunder echoed in the sky. Then came anotherflash and a second man emerged before  the administrator -- short, but  withathletic shoulders, hair red as fire, albugo in one eye, a fang in his mouth. . . This second  one, evidently a lefty, socked  the administrator on theother ear. In response there  was another roll  of  thunder  in the sky, andrain poured down on the wooden roof of the toilet.     'What  is  it,  comr.  ..'  the  half-crazed  administrator  whispered,realized at once that the word 'comrades' hardly  fitted bandits attacking aman in a public  toilet, rasped out: 'citiz . . .' -- figured  that they didnot  merit this appellation either, and received a third  terrible blow fromhe did not know which of them, so that blood gushed from his nose on  to hisTolstoy blouse.     'What you got in  the  briefcase,  parasite?' the  one resembling a catcried shrilly. 'Telegrams? Weren't  you  warned over the  phone not to  takethem anywhere? Weren't you warned, I'm asking you?'     'I  was  wor ... wer  ... warned .  . .'  the  administrator  answered,suffocating.     'And  you skipped off anyway?  Gimme the briefcase, vermin!' the secondone  cried in the same nasal voice that had  come over the telephone, and heyanked the briefcase from Varenukha's trembling hands.    And the two picked the administrator up under the arms, dragged him outof the  garden, and raced down  Sadovaya with him. The  storm  raged at fullforce,  water streamed  with  a noise and  howling  down  the  drains, wavesbubbled  and  billowed  everywhere, water  gushed  from  the roofs  past thedrainpipes,  foamy streams  ran from gateways. Everything living  got washedoff Sadovaya, and there was no one to save Ivan Savelyevich. Leaping throughmuddy rivers, under flashes of lightning, the bandits dragged the half-aliveadministrator in a  split  second  to  no.502-bis, flew with him through thegateway,  where two barefoot  women, holding  their shoes and  stockings  intheir hands, pressed themselves to the wall. Then they dashed into the sixthentrance, and Varenukha, nearly  insane, was taken up to the fifth floor andthrown  down in  the  semi-dark front hall, so well known to him,  of StyopaLikhodeev's apartment.     Here the two robbers vanished, and in their place there appeared in thefront hall a completelynaked girl  --  red-haired, her  eyes burning with aphosphorescent gleam.     Varenukha understood that this was the most terrible of all things thathad ever happened  to him and,  moaning, recoiled against the  wall. But thegirl came right up to the administrator and placed the palms of her hands onhis shoulders. Varenukha's hair stood on end, because even through the cold,water-soaked cloth of his Tolstoy blouse he could feel that those palms werestill colder, that their cold was the cold of ice.     'Let  me give  you  a kiss,'  the girl  said tenderly,  and there  wereshining eyes right  in front  of his eyes. Then Varenukha fainted  and neverfelt the kiss.
CHAPTER 11. Ivan Splits in Two        The woods on the opposite bank of the river, sdll lit up by the May sunan hour earlier, turned dull, smeary, and dissolved.     Water  fell  down  in a  solid sheet  outside  the  window. In the sky,threads flashed every moment, the sky kept bursting open, and the  patient'sroom was flooded with a tremulous, frightening light.     Ivan  quietly  wept,  sitting on his bed  and looking  out at the muddyriver boiling with bubbles. At every clap of thunder, he cried out pitifullyand  buried his face in his  hands.  Pages covered  with Ivan's writing  layabout on the floor. They had been blown down by the wind that flew  into theroom before the storm began.     The  poet's  attempts  to write  a statement  concerning  the  terribleconsultant had gone  nowhere. As soon as  he got  the  pencil stub and paperfrom the fat  attendant, whose name  was Praskovya Fyodorovna, he rubbed hishands  in a business-like way  and  hastily settled  himself  at  the littletable. The beginning came out quite glibly.    To  the  police.  From Massolit  member Ivan  Nikolaevich  Homeless.  Astatement.  Yesterday  evening  I came  to the  Patriarch's  Ponds with  thedeceased M. A. Berlioz . ..'     And  right there  the  poet  got  confused, mainly  owing  to  the word'deceased'.  Some nonsensicality  emerged at once: what's this  -- came withthe deceased? The deceased don't go  anywhere! Really, for all he knew, theymight take him for a madman!     Having reflected  thus,  Ivan Nikolaevich  began to correct what he hadwritten.  What  came  out  this  time  was:  '.  .  . with  M.  A.  Berlioz,subsequently deceased . . .' This did not satisfy the author either. He  hadto have recourse to  a third  redaction, which proved still worse  than  thefirst two: 'Berlioz, who fell  under the tram-car . ..' - and that  namesakecomposer, unknown to anyone,  "was also dangling here, so he had to  put in:'not the composer . . .'     After suffering over these two Berliozes, Ivan  crossed it  all out anddecided to begin right off with  somethingvery strong, in order  to attractthe  reader's  attention  at once, so  he  wrote  that a  cat had  got on  atram-car, and then went back to the episode with the severed head. The  headand  the consultant's  prediction led  him to the thought of Pontius Pilate,and for  greater  conviction  Ivan  decided  to tell  the whole story of theprocurator  in full, from the moment  he walked out in his white cloak  withblood-red lining to the colonnade of Herod's palace.     Ivan  worked assiduously, crossing out what he had written,  putting innew words, and even attempted to draw Pontius Pilate and then a cat standingon its  hind  legs. But the  drawings did not help, and the further it went,the more confusing and incomprehensible the poet's statement became.     By the time the frightening cloud with smoking edges appeared from  faroff and covered the woods, and the wind began to blow, Ivan felt that he wasstrengthless, that he would never be able to manage with the statement,  andhe  would not pick up the scattered pages,and he wept quietly and bitterly.The  good-natured nurse Praskovya Fyodorovna visited  the  poet  during  thestorm, became alarmed on seeing him  weeping, closed the  blinds so that thelightning  would  not frighten the patient,  picked up the  pages  from  thefloor, and ran with them for the doctor.     He came, gave  Ivan an injection in the  arm, and  assured him that  hewould not weep any  more, that everything would  pass  now, everything wouldchange, everything would be forgotten.     The  doctor proved  right.  Soon  the  woods across the river became asbefore. It was outlined to the last tree under the sky, which cleared to itsformer perfect blue, and the  river  grew calm. Anguish  had begun to  leaveIvan right after the injection, and  now the  poet  lay calmly and looked atthe rainbow that stretched across the sky.     So it  went till evening,  and he  did not  even notice how the rainbowmelted away, how the sky saddened and faded, how the woods turned black.     Having drunk  some hot milk, Ivan laydown again and  marvelled himselfat how changed his thinking was. The  accursed, demonic cat somehow softenedin  his  memory,  the  severed head did  not  frighten  him  any more,  and,abandoning all thought of it, Ivan  began to  reflect  that, essentially, itwas not so bad in the clinic, that Stravinsky was a  clever man and a famousone,  and it was quite pleasant to deal with him. Besides,  the  evening airwas sweet and fresh after the storm.     The house of sorrow was  falling asleep. In quiet corridors the frostedwhite lights went out, and in  their place, according to regulations,  faintblue night-lights were lit, and the careful steps  of  attendants were heardmore and more rarely on the rubber matting of  the corridor outside the door.     Now Ivan  lay in sweet languor,  glancing at the lamp  under its shade,shedding a softened light from  the ceiling, then at the moon  rising behindthe black woods, and conversed with himself.     'Why,  actually,  did I get so  excited  about  Berlioz falling under atram-car?'the poet reasoned. 'In  the final analysis, let him sink! What amI, in  fact, his chum or in-law? If we air the question  properly,  it turnsout that, in essence, I really did not even know the deceased. What, indeed,did I know about him? Nothing except that he was bald and terribly eloquent.And furthermore, citizens,' Ivan continued his speech, addressing someone orother,  'let's  sort  this  out:  why, tell  me,  did I get furious  at thismysterious consultant, magician and professor with the black and  empty eye?Why  all this  absurd chase after him in underpants and with  a candle in myhand, and then those wild shenanigans in the restaurant?'     'Uh-uh-uh!' the  former  Ivan suddenly  said sternly  somewhere, eitherinside  or over his  ear,  to  the new  Ivan. 'He  did  know beforehand thatBerlioz's head would be cut off, didn't he? How could I not get excited?'     'What are  we talking  about, comrades?' the  new Ivan objected  to theold, former Ivan. That things  are not  quite  proper here, even a childcanunderstand.  He's  a one-hundred-per-cent outstanding and mysterious person!But  that's  the most interesting thing!  The man was  personally acquaintedwith Pontius Pilate, what could be more  interesting than that? And, insteadof  raising  a  stupid  rumpus  at  the Ponds, wouldn't  it  have  been moreintelligent  to question him  politely about what  happened further  on withPilate  and his  prisoner Ha-Nozri?  And I started devil knows what! A majoroccurrence, really - a  magazine editor gets run over! And  so, what, is themagazine going to shut down for that? Well, what can  be done  about it? Manis mortal and, as has rightly  been said, unexpectedly mortal. Well,  may herest  in  peace!  Well, so there'll be  another  editor, and maybe even moreeloquent than the previous one!'     After  dozing  for  a  while,  the  new   Ivan  asked   the  old   Ivansarcastically:     'And what does it make me, in that case?'     'A fool!' a bass voice said distinctly somewhere, a voice not belongingto either of the Ivansand extremely like the bass of the consultant.     Ivan, for  some reason not  offended  by  the  word  'fool',  but  evenpleasantly  surprised  at  it,  smiled  and drowsily grew  quiet.  Sleep wasstealing  over  Ivan,  and  he  was  already  picturing a  palm tree on  itselephant's leg, and a cat passing by - not scary, but merry - and, in short,sleep  was  just about to  come  over  Ivan, when the  grille suddenly movednoiselessly aside, and  a  mysterious figure appeared on the balcony, hidingfrom the moonlight, and shook its finger at Ivan.     Not frightened in the least, Ivan sat  up in bed and saw that there wasa  man  on  the balcony.  And  this  man,  pressing  a finger  to  his lips,whispered:     'Shhh!...'
CHAPTER 12. Black Magic and Its Exposure        A  small  man  in  a  yellow  bowler-hat  full  of  holes  and  with  apear-shaped,   raspberry-coloured   nose,   in   checkered    trousers   andpatent-leather  shoes, rolled out  on  to the  stage  of the Variety  on  anordinary two-wheeled  bicycle. To the sounds of a foxtrot  he made a circle,and then gave a triumphant shout, which caused his bicycle to rear up. Afterriding  around  on  the  back wheel,  the little  man  turned  upside  down,contrived while in motion to unscrew the front wheel and  send it backstage,and then proceeded  on his  way with one wheel, turning the pedals  with hishands.     On a tall metal pole with a seat at the top and a single wheel, a plumpblonde rolled out in tights and a little skirt strewn with silver stars, andbegan  riding in a circle. As  he met  her, the little man uttered cries  ofgreeting, doffing his bowler-hat with his foot.     Finally, a little eight-year-old with an elderly face came  rolling outand  began scooting  about among the adults on atiny two-wheeler  furnishedwith an enormous automobile horn.     After  making  several  loops,  the  whole  company,  to  the  alarmingdrum-beats of the  orchestra, rolled to the  very edge of the stage, and thespectators in the front rows  gasped and drew back, because it seemed to thepublic that the whole trio with  its vehicles was about to  crash  down intothe orchestra pit.     But the  bicycles stopped  just  at  the moment  when the front  wheelsthreatened to slide into the abyss  on the heads of the  musicians.  With  aloud shout of 'Hup!' the cyclists jumped off their vehicles  and  bowed, theblonde woman blowing kisses  to  the public,  and the little one  tooting  afunny signal on his horn.     Applause  shook the  building, the light-blue  curtain  came from  bothsides and covered the cyclists,  the green 'Exit'  lights by  the doors wentout, and in the web of trapezes under the  cupola white spheres lit up  likethe sun. It was die intermission before die last part.     The only man who was not theleast bit interested in the wonders of theGiulli family's cycling technique was Grigory Danilovich Rimsky.     In complete  solitude  he sat  in his office, biting  his thin lips,  aspasm  passing  over  his  face  from  time  to time.  To  the extraordinarydisappearance  of  Likhodeev  had  now  been  added  the  wholly  unforeseendisappearance of Varenukha.     Rimsky knew where he had gone, but he had gone and . . . not come back!Rimsky shrugged his shoulders and whispered to himself:     'But what for?'     And it was strange: for such a  practical man  as the findirector,  thesimplest thing would, of course, have been to call the place where Varenukhahad  gone  and  find out  what had  befallen him,  yet until  ten o'clock atnight'he had been unable to force himself to do it.     At  ten,  doing outright  violence to  himself, Rimsky  picked  up  thereceiver  and  here  discovered  that his telephone was dead. The  messengerreported that the other telephones in  the building were  also out of order.This certainlyunpleasant, though  hardly supernatural,  occurrence for somereason thoroughly shocked the findirector, but at the same time he was glad:the need to call fell away.     Just as the  red light over the findirector's head  lit up and blinked,announcing the  beginning  of  the  intermission, a  messenger  came in  andinformed him of the  foreign artiste's arrival. The  findirector cringed forsome reason, and, blacker than a storm  cloud, went backstage to receive thevisitor, since there was no one else to receive him.     Under  various  pretexts,  curious  people  kept  peeking into the  bigdressing room from the  corridor, where the signal bell was already ringing.Among them were conjurers in bright robes and  turbans, a skater in a  whiteknitted jacket, a storyteller pale with powder and the make-up man.     The newly arrived celebrity  struck  everyone by  his marvellously  cuttailcoat,  of a length  never seen before, and by his having come in a blackhalf-mask.  But  most  remarkable  of  all were  the  black magician's  twocompanions: a  long checkered one with  a cracked pince-nez, and a fat blackcat who came into the dressing room on his hind legs  and quite nonchalantlysat on the sofa squinting at the bare make-up lights.     Rimsky  attempted to produce a smile on his face,  which  made it  looksour and spiteful, and bowed to the silent black magician, who was seated onthe sofa beside  the  cat. There was  no  handshake. Instead,  the easygoingcheckered one  made  his  own  introductions  to  the  fin-director, callinghimself 'the gent's assistant'. This circumstance surprised the findirector,and unpleasantly so: there was decidedly no mention of any assistant in  thecontract.     Quite  stiffly   and  drily,  Grigory  Danilovich   inquired   of  thisfallen-from-the-sky checkered one where the artiste's paraphernalia was.     'Our heavenly diamond, most  precious mister director,' the  magician'sassistant replied in a rattling voice, 'the paraphernalia is always with us.Here it is! Ein, zwei, drei!' And, wavinghis knotty fingers before Rimsky'seyes, he suddenly took from behind the cat's ear Rimsky's own gold watch andchain, hitherto worn by the findirector in his  waistcoat pocket, under  hisbuttoned coat, with the chain through a buttonhole.     Rimsky  inadvertently clutched his  stomach, those  present gasped, andthe make-up man, peeking in the doorway, grunted approvingly.     Tour  little watchie? Kindly take it,' the checkered  one said, smilingcasually and offering  the bewildered Rimsky  his  own  property  on a dirtypalm.     'No getting on a tram with that one,' the storyteller whispered quietlyand merrily to the make-up man.     But the cat  pulled a neater  trick  than  the number  with the  stolenwatch. Getting up from the sofa unexpectedly,  he walked on his hind legs tothe dressing table, pulled the stopper out of the carafe with his front paw,poured water into a glass, drank it, installed the stopper in its place, andwiped his whiskers with a make-up cloth.     Here no one even gasped, their mouths simplyfell open, and the make-upman whispered admiringly:     'That's class!'     Just  then the bells rang alarmingly for  the third time, and everyone,agitated  and  anticipating  an interesting  number,  thronged  out  of  thedressing room.     A moment  later  the spheres went out  in the  theatre, the  footlightsblazed up,  lending  a reddish  glow to the base of the curtain, and  in thelighted gap of  the curtain there appeared before the public  a  plump  man,merry  as  a  baby,  with  a clean-shaven face,  in  a rumpled tailcoat  andnone-too-fresh shirt. This was the master of ceremonies, well  known  to allMoscow -- Georges Bengalsky.     'And now, citizens,' Bengalsky began, smiling his baby smile, 'there isabout to come  before you ...' Here Bengalsky interrupted himself and  spokein a different tone: 'I see the audience has grown for the third part. We'vegot  half the city here! I met a friend the  other day and said to him: "Whydon't you come to our show? Yesterday we had half the city." And he says tome:  "I live in  the other half!"' Bengalsky  paused, waiting for a burst oflaughter, but as  no one  laughed, he went on: '. . . And so,  now comes thefamous foreign artiste. Monsieur Woland, with a seance of black magic. Well,both you and I know,'  here Bengalsky  smiled a wise smile, 'that there's nosuch  thing in  the world, and that it's all just superstition,  and MaestroWoland is simply a perfect master of the technique of conjuring, as we shallsee from the most interesting part, that is, the exposure of this technique,and since we're all of  us to a man both for technique and for its exposure,let's bring on Mr Woland! ...'     After uttering all this claptrap, Bengalsky pressed  his palms togetherand waved them in greeting through the slit of  the curtain, which caused itto part with a soft rustic.     The entrance of the magician with his  long assistant and the cat,  whocame on stage on his hind legs, pleased the audience greatly.     'An armchair  for  me,' Woland  ordered in   a low voice, and that samesecond an armchair appeared  on  stage, no  one  knew  how or from where, inwhich the magician sat down. 'Tell me, my gentle Fagott,' Woland inquired ofthe  checkered clown, who  evidently had another appellation than  Koroviev,'what  do you think,  the  Moscow populace has changed significantly, hasn'tit?'     The  magician  looked  out  at  the  hushed  audience,  struck  by  theappearance of the armchair out of nowhere.     "That it has, Messire,' Fagott-Koroviev replied in a low voice.     "You're right. The  city folk have  changed greatly  . . .  externally,that is ... as has the city itself, incidentally.  . . Not  to mention theirclothing, these ...  what do you call them . . . trams, automobiles ... haveappeared...'     'Buses .. .'-Fagott prompted deferentially.     The  audience listened attentively to  this  conversation,  thinking itconstituted  a  prelude  to the magic  tricks.  The wings  were  packed withperformers and stage-hands, and among  their faces could be  seenthe tense,pale face of Rimsky.     The physiognomy of  Bengalsky,  who  had retreated  to the side of  thestage, began  to  show  some perplexity. He raised one eyebrow slighdy  and,taking advantage of a pause, spoke:     "The  foreign artiste is expressing his admiration  for Moscow and  itstechnological development, as  well as for  the  Muscovites.' Here Bengalskysmiled twice, first to the stalls, then to the gallery.     Woland, Fagott and the cat  turned their heads  in the direction of themaster of ceremonies.     'Did I express admiration?' the magician asked the checkered Fagott.     'By no  means,  Messire, you never expressed  any admiration,' came thereply.     Then what is the man saying?'     'He quite  simply lied!' the  checkered assistant declared  sonorously,for the whole theatre to hear, and turning to Bengalsky, he added:     'Congrats, citizen, you done lied!'     Tittering spattered  from the  gallery, but Bengalsky gave a  start andgoggled his eyes.     'Of course, I'm not so much interestedin buses, telephones and other .. .'     'Apparatuses,' the checkered one prompted.     'Quite right, thank you,' the magician  spoke slowly  in a  heavy bass,'as  in  a  question of much  greater importance: have the city folk changedinwardly?'     "Yes, that is the most important question, sir.'     There  was  shrugging  and  an  exchanging  of  glances  in  the wings,Bengalsky stood  all red, and Rimsky was pale.  But  here, as if sensing thenascent alarm, the magician said:     'However, we're  talking  away, my  dear Fagott, and  the  audience  isbeginning to get bored. My gende Fagott, show us some simple little thing tostart with.'     The audience stirred. Fagott and the cat walked along the footlights toopposite  sides  of  the  stage.  Fagott snapped  his fingers,  and  with  arollicking Three, four!' snatched a deck of cards from the air, shuffled it,and sent it in a long ribbon to the cat. The cat intercepted it and  sent itback. The satiny snake whiffled, Fagott opened his mouth like a nestlingandswallowed it all card by card. After which the cat bowed, scraping his righthind paw, winning himself unbelievable applause.     'Class! Real class!' rapturous shouts came from the wings.     And Fagott jabbed his finger at the stalls and announced:     'You'll find that same deck, esteemed  citizens,  on citizen Parchevskyin the seventh row, just between a three-rouble bill and  a summons to courtin connection with the payment of alimony to citizen Zeikova.'     There was a stirring in the stalls, people began to get up, and finallysome citizen whose name  was  indeed Parchevsky, all crimson with amazement,extracted  the deck from his wallet and began sticking it up in the air, notknowing what to do with it.     'YOU may keep it as a souvenir!' cried Fagott. 'Not for nothing did yousay at dinner  yesterday that if it weren't for poker  your  life  in Moscowwould be utterly unbearable.'     'An  old trick!' came from the gallery. The one  in  the stalls is fromthe same company.'     'You think so?' shouted Fagott,squinting at the gallery. 'In that caseyou're also one of us, because the deck is now in your pocket!'     There was movement in the balcony, and a joyful voice said:     'Right! He's got it! Here, here! . . . Wait! It's ten-rouble bills!'     Those  sitting in  the stalls turned  their  heads. In  the  gallery  abewildered  citizen found in his  pocket  a  bank-wrapped packet  with  'Onethousand roubles' written on it. His neighbours hovered over him, and he, inamazement, picked at  the wrapper with his fingernail, trying to find out ifthe bills were real or some sort of magic ones.     'By God, they're real!  Ten-rouble  bills!'  joyful cries came from thegallery.     'I want to play with the same kind of deck,' a fat man in the middle ofthe stalls requested merrily.     'Avec  playzeer!'  Fagott responded. 'But  why just you? Everyone  willwarmly participate!'  And he commanded: 'Look up, please! .  ..  One!' Therewas  a pistol in his hand. He shouted: 'Two!' The pistol was  pointed up. Heshouted: 'Three!' Therewas a flash, a bang, and all at once, from under thecupola, bobbing between  the trapezes, white strips of  paper  began fallinginto the theatre.     They twirled, got blown aside, were drawn  towards the gallery, bouncedinto the orchestra and on to the stage. In a few seconds, the rain of money,ever  thickening,  reached the  seats, and the spectators began snatching atit.     Hundreds  of arms were raised, the spectators held the bills up to  thelighted stage and saw the most  true and honest-to-God watermarks. The smellalso left no  doubts: it was the incomparably  delightful  smell of  freshlyprinted money. The whole  theatre was seized first  with merriment  and thenwith amazement. The word 'money, money!' hummed everywhere, there were gaspsof 'ah, ah!' and  merry  laughter. One or two were already  crawling  in theaisles,  feeling under the chairs. Many stood on the seats,  trying to catchthe flighty, capricious notes.     Bewilderment was gradually coming  to  the faces of the  policemen, andperformers unceremoniouslybegan sticking their heads out from the wings.     In the dress circle a  voice was heard: 'What're  you grabbing at? It'smine,  it flew to me!' and another  voice:  'Don't shove  me, or you'll  getshoved  back!'  And  suddenly there came the sound  of a  whack.  At  once apoliceman's helmet appeared in the  dress circle, and someone from the dresscircle was led away.     The  general  agitation was increasing,  and no one knows where  it allwould have ended  if Fagott had not  stopped the rain  of money  by suddenlyblowing into the air.     Two  young men, exchanging significant and merry glances, took off fromtheir seats  and  made  straight  for  the  buffet.  There was a hum in  thetheatre,  all the  spectators'  eyes glittered excitedly.  Yes,  yes, no oneknows  where  it all  would  have ended if Bengalsky had  not  summoned  hisstrength  and acted. Trying to gain better control of himself, he rubbed hishands, as was his custom, and in his most resounding voice spoke thus:     'Here, citizens, you  and  Ihave just beheld a case of  so-called masshypnosis. A purely scientific  experiment, proving in the best way  possiblethat  there are  no  miracles in magic. Let us  ask Maestro Woland to exposethis experiment  for  us. Presendy,  citizens,  you will see these  supposedbanknotes disappear as suddenly as they appeared.'     Here he  applauded, but quite alone, while a confident  smile played onhis  face,  yet  in his eyes  there  was no such confidence,  but  rather anexpression of entreaty.     The audience did not like Bengalsky's speech. Total silence fell, whichwas broken by the checkered Fagott.     'And  this is a case  of  so-called  lying,'  he  announced in a  loud,goatish tenor. The notes, citizens, are genuine.'     'Bravo!' a bass barked from somewhere on high.     This one, incidentally,' here  Fagott pointed to Bengalsky, 'annoys me.Keeps poking his nose where nobody's asked him, spoils the seance with falseobservations! What're we going to do with him?'     Tear his head off!' someone up in the gallerysaid severely.     'What's that you said? Eh?' Fagott responded at once to this outrageoussuggestion. Tear his head off? There's an idea! Behemoth!' he shouted to thecat. 'Go to it! Bin, zwei, drei!!'     And an  unheard-of thing  occurred. The fur bristled on the cat's back,and he gave a rending miaow. Then he compressed himself into a ball and shotlike a panther straight at Bengalsky's chest, and from there on to his head.Growling, the cat sank his  plump  paws into  the  skimpy  chevelure of  themaster  of ceremonies  and in two twists tore the head  from  the thick neckwith a savage howl.     The  two and  a half thousand people in the  theatre cried out as  one.Blood  spurted in fountains from the  torn neck arteries and poured over theshirt-front  and tailcoat.  The  headless  body  paddled  its  feet  somehowabsurdly and sat down  on the floor. Hysterical women's  cries came from theaudience. The  cat handed the head to Fagott,  who lifted it  up by the hairand showed it to  the  audience, and the  headcried desperately for all thetheatre to hear:     'A doctor!'     'Will you pour out such drivel in the future?' Fagott asked the weepinghead menacingly.     'Never again!' croaked the head.     'For God's sake, don't torture  him!'  a woman's voice  from a box seatsuddenly rose above the clamour, and the magician turned in the direction ofthat voice.     'So,  what  then,  citizens,  shall  we  forgive  him?'  Fagott  asked,addressing the audience.     'Forgive him, forgive him!'  separate  voices,  mostly  women's,  spokefirst, then merged into one chorus with the men's.     'What are your orders, Messire?' Fagott asked the masked man.     'Well, now,'  the  latter replied pensively,  'they're people  like anyother people  . .. They love money, but that  has always been so ... Mankindloves money,  whatever it's  made of-  leather,  paper, bronze, gold.  Well,they're  light-minded . . . well, what of it  ... mercy  sometimes knocks attheir hearts . . . ordinary people ... In general, reminiscent of the formerones. .. only the housing problem has corrupted them ..  .'  And he orderedloudly: 'Put the head on.'     The cat,  aiming  accurately, planted the head on the neck,  and it satexactly in its place, as if it had never gone anywhere. Above all, there wasnot even any scar left on the neck. The cat brushed Bengalsky's tailcoat andshirt-front with his  paws, and all  traces of blood disappeared from  them.Fagott got the sitting  Bengalsky to his feet, stuck a  packet of money intohis coat pocket, and sent him from the stage with the words:     'Buzz off, it's more fun without you!'     Staggering and looking around senselessly, the master of ceremonies hadplodded  no  farther than the  fire  post  when he  felt sick.  He cried outpitifully:     'My head, my head!...'     Among those who  rushed to  him was Rimsky.  The  master of  ceremonieswept, snatched at something in the air with his hands, and muttered:     'Give me my head, give me  back my head . .. Take my apartment, take mypaintings, only give me back my head!. . .'     A messenger ran for a doctor. They tried to  lie  Bengalsky  down  on asofa in  the dressing room,  but he  began to struggle, became violent. Theyhad  to call  an  ambulance.  When  the unfortunate master of ceremonies wastaken away, Rimsky ran  back  to  the  stage and saw  that  new wonders weretaking place on it.  Ah, yes, incidentally, either then or a little earlier,the magician disappeared from the stage  together  with  his faded armchair,and it must be said that the public took absolutely no notice of it, carriedaway as it was by the extraordinary things Fagott was unfolding on stage.     And  Fagott,  having packed  off  the  punished master  of  ceremonies,addressed the public thus:     'All  righty,  now  that we've kicked that  nuisance out, let's  open aladies' shop!'     And  all  at once the  floor  of  the  stage  was  covered with Persiancarpets,  huge  mirrors appeared, lit  by  greenish tubes at the sides,  andbetween  the mirrors --  display windows, and in them the merrily astonishedspectatorssaw Parisian ladies' dresses of various colours and cuts. In someof the  windows, that is, while in others there appeared hundreds of ladies'hats, with feathers and  without feathers, and -- with buckles or without --hundreds of shoes, black, white, yellow, leather, satin, suede, with straps,with  stones.  Among the shoes there appeared cases of perfume, mountains ofhandbags of  antelope hide,  suede,  silk, and among these, whole  heaps  oflittle elongated cases of gold metal such as usually contain lipstick.     A  red-headed girl appeared from devil  knows where in a  black eveningdress -- a girl nice in  all  respects,  had she not been  marred by a queerscar on her neck - smiling a proprietary smile by the display windows.     Fagott,  grinning  sweetly,  announced   that  the  firm  was  offeringperfectly  gratis  an exchange of  the  ladies'  old dresses  and  shoes forParisian  models  and  Parisian  shoes.  The  same held,  he added,  for thehandbags and other things.     The cat began scraping with hishind paw, while his front paw performedthe gestures appropriate to a doorman opening a door.     The girl  sang out  sweetly, though  with some hoarseness, rolling  herr's, something not quite comprehensible but, judging by the women's faces inthe stalls, very tempting:     'Gueriain,  Chanel, Mitsouko,  Narcisse  Noir, Chanel  No.  5,  eveninggowns, cocktail dresses . . .'     Fagott wriggled, the cat bowed, the girl opened the glass windows.     'Welcome!' yelled Fagott. With no embarrassment or ceremony!'     The audience was excited, but as yet no one ventured on stage.  Finallysome brunette stood up in the tenth row of the  stalls and, smiling as if tosay it was all the same to her and she did not give a hoot, went and climbedon stage by the side stairs.     'Bravo!' Fagott shouted. 'Greetings to the  first customer! Behemoth, achair! Let's start with the shoes, madame.'     The  brunette sat in the chair, and Fagott at once poured a  whole heapof shoes on the rug in front of her. The  brunette  removed her right shoe,tried a lilac one, stamped on the rug, examined the heel.     They won't pinch?' she asked pensively.     To this Fagott exclaimed with a hurt air:     'Come, come!' and the cat miaowed resentfully.     'I'll take this pair, m'sieur,' the brunette said with dignity, puttingon the second shoe as well.     The  brunette's  old  shoes  were  tossed  behind a  curtain,  and  sheproceeded there herself, accompanied by the red-headed girl  and Fagott, whowas carrying several fashionable dresses  on hangers.  The cat busded about,helped, and for greater importance hung a measuring tape around his neck.     A  minute  later the brunette came  from behind  the  curtain in such adress that the stalls all let out  a gasp.  The brave woman, who had  becomeastonishingly prettier,  stopped at  the mirror, moved  her  bare shoulders,touched the hair on her nape and, twisting, tried to peek at her back.     The firm asks you to accept  this  as a souvenir,'  said Fagott, and heoffered the brunette an open case witha flacon in it     'Merci,'  the  brunette said  haughtily and went down the steps  to thestalls. As she walked, the spectators jumped up and touched the case.     And  here there came a clean breakthrough,  and  from all  sides  womenmarched  on to the stage. Amid the  general agitation of talk, chuckles  andgasps, a man's voice was heard: 'I won't allow it!' and a woman's:     'Despot  and philistine! Don't break my  arm!' Women disappeared behindthe curtain, leaving their dresses there and coming out in new ones. A wholerow  of  ladies  sat  on  stools  with  gilded  legs,  stamping  the  carpetenergetically  with newly shod feet. Fagott was on his  knees,  working awaywith  a metal shoehorn; the cat, fainting  under  piles of purses and shoes,plodded back and forth between the display windows and the stools;  the girlwith the  disfigured neck  appeared and  disappeared, and reached  the pointwhere she  started rattling away entirely in French, and,  surprisingly, thewomen all  understood her from half a word, even  those who did  not know asingle word of French.     General  amazement was  aroused by  a  man edging  his way on-stage. Heannounced that his wife had  the flu, and he therefore asked that  somethingbe sent to her through him. As proof that he was indeed married, the citizenwas prepared to show his passport. The solicitous husband's announcement wasmet with guffaws. Fagott  shouted that he believed  him  like  his own self,even  without  the passport,  and  handed  the  citizen  two pairs  of  silkstockings, and the cat for his part added a little tube of lipstick.     Late-coming women  tore on  to the stage, and off the  stage  the luckyones  came pouring down  in ball gowns, pyjamas  with  dragons, sober formaloutfits, little hats tipped over one eyebrow.     Then Fagott announced that owing to the lateness of the  hour, the shopwould  close  in  exactly  one  minute  until  the  next  evening,   and  anunbelievable  scramble  arose on-stage. Women  hastily grabbed shoes withouttrying them on. One burstbehind the curtain  like a storm, got out  of  herdress there, took possession of the first thing that  came to hand -- a silkdressing-gown covered with huge bouquets -- and managed to pick up two casesof perfume besides.     Exactly a minute later a pistol shot rang out, the mirrors disappeared,the  display windows and stools dropped away, the carpet melted into air, asdid the curtain.  Last to disappear was the high mountain of old dresses andshoes, and the stage was again severe, empty and bare.     And it was here that a new character mixed into the affair. A pleasant,sonorous, and very insistent baritone came from box no. 2:     'All the same  it  is  desirable, citizen artiste, that you  expose thetechnique of your tricks  to the  spectators  without delay,  especially thetrick  with  the  paper  money.  It  is also  desirable that the  master  ofceremonies return  to  the  stage.  The spectators are concerned  about  hisfate.'     The  baritone  belonged  to  none other  than  that  evening's guest ofhonour, Arkady   Apollonovich  Sempleyarov,  chairman  of   the   AcousticsCommission of the Moscow theatres.     Arkady  Apollonovich  was  in  his  box with two ladies: the  older onedressed expensively  and  fashionably,  the  other  one,  young  and pretty,dressed  in  a  simpler way. The first, as  was soon  discovered during  thedrawing up of the report, was Arkady Apollonovich's wife, and the second washis distant relation,  a  promising debutante, who had come from Saratov andwas living in the apartment of Arkady Apollonovich and his wife.     Tardone!'  Fagott replied. 'I'm sorry, there's nothing here to  expose,it's all clear.'     'No,  excuse me! The exposure is absolutely necessary.  Without it yourbrilliant numbers  will  leave a painful impression. The mass of  spectatorsdemands an explanation.'     'The mass of  spectators,' the  impudent clown interrupted Sempleyarov,'doesn't  seem to  be saying  anything. But,  in consideration of  your mostesteemed desire, Arkady Apollonovich, so be it - I will performan exposure.But, to that end, will you allow me one more tiny number?'     'Why not?' Arkady  Apollonovich replied patronizingly. 'But there  mustbe an exposure.'     'Very well,  very well, sir.  And so, allow me to ask,  where were  youlast evening, Arkady Apollonovich?'     At  this  inappropriate  and  perhaps  even  boorish  question,  ArkadyApollonovich's countenance changed, and changed quite drastically.     'Last  evening Arkady  Apollonovich was  at a meeting  of the AcousticsCommission,' Arkady  Apollonovich's  wife declared  very  haughtily, "but  Idon't understand what that has got to do with magic.'     'Ouee, madame!' Fagott agreed. 'Naturally you don't understand.  As forthe meeting, you are totally deluded. After driving off to the said meeting,which   incidentally  was  not   even   scheduled  for  last  night,  ArkadyApollonovich dismissed his chauffeur at the Acoustics Commission building onClean  Ponds'  (the whole  theatre  became  hushed),  'and  went by  bus  toYelokhovskaya  Street to  visit  an actress  from  the  regional  itineranttheatre, Militsa Andreevna Pokobatko, with whom he spent some four hours.'     'Aie!'  someone cried  out  painfully  in  the  total  silence.  ArkadyApollonovich's young relation suddenly broke into a low and terrible laugh.     'It's all clear!' she exclaimed. 'And I've long suspected it. Now I seewhy that giftless thing got the role of Louisa!''     And, swinging suddenly, she struck Arkady Apollonovich on the head withher short and fat violet umbrella.     Meanwhile, the scoundrelly Fagott, alias Koroviev, was shouting:     'Here,  honourable  citizens,  is  one  case  of  the  exposure  ArkadyApollonovich so importunately insisted on!'     'How dare  you touch Arkady  Apollonovich, you  vile  creature!' ArkadyApollonovich's wife  asked  threateningly,  rising  in  the  box  to all hergigantic height.     A second brief wave of satanic laughter seized the young relation. 'Whoelse should dare touch him,' she answered,  guffawing, 'if not  me!' And forthe secondtime there came the dry, crackling sound of the umbrella bouncingoff the head of Arkady Apollonovich.     'Police!  Seize her!!'  Sempleyarov's wife shouted  in  such a terriblevoice that many hearts went cold.     And here the cat  also leaped out to the footlights and suddenly barkedin a human voice for all the theatre to hear:     The  seance is over!  Maestro!  Hack  out  a  march!'  The  half-crazedconductor, unaware  of what he was doing, waved his baton, and the orchestradid not play, or even strike up, or even bang away at, but precisely, in thecat's  loathsome  expression,  hacked  out  some   incredible  march  of  anunheard-of brashness.     For a  moment there was an illusion  of  having heard once upon a time,under  southern  stars,  in  a  cafe-chantant,  some  barely   intelligible,half-blind, but rollicking words to this march:     His Excellency reached the stage     Of liking barnyard fowl.     He took under his patronage     Three young girls and an owl!!!     Or maybe these were not  the wordsat all, but there were others to thesame music,  extremely indecent  ones. That is not the important  thing, theimportant thing is that, after all this, something like babel broke loose inthe  Variety. The police  went  running to  Sempleyarov's  box,  people wereclimbing  over the  barriers,  there  were bursts  of infernal guffawing andfurious shouts, drowned in the golden clash of the orchestra's cymbals.     And one  could  see  that the stage was  suddenly empty, and  that  thehoodwinker Fagott, as well as the brazen tom-cat Behemoth, had  melted  intoair,  vanished as the magician had vanished earlier in his armchair with thefaded upholstery.
CHAPTER 13. The Hero Enters        And so,  the  unknown  man shook  his finger  at  Ivan  and  whispered:'Shhh!.. .'     Ivan lowered his legs from the bed and  peered. Cautiously looking intothe  room  from  the   balcony  was  a  clean-shaven,   dark-haired  man  ofapproximately  thirty-eight, with a sharp nose, anxious  eyes, and a wisp ofhair hanging down on his forehead.     Having  listened and  made  sure  that Ivan was  alone, the  mysteriousvisitor took heart and stepped into the room. Here Ivan saw that the man wasdressed  as a patient. He  was wearing long underwear,  slippers on his barefeet, and a brown dressing-gown thrown over his shoulders.     The visitor winked at Ivan, hid a bunch of keys in his pocket, inquiredin a whisper: 'May I sit down?' --  and receiving an affirmative nod, placedhimself in an armchair.     'How did you get here?' Ivan asked in a whisper, obeying the dry fingershaken at him. 'Aren't the balcony grilles locked?'     The grilles are locked,' the guest agreed,  'but  Praskovya Fyodorovna,whilethe  dearest person, is also, alas, quite absent-minded. A month ago Istole a bunch of keys from her, and so gained the opportunity of getting outon  to  the common balcony, which runs around the entire  floor,  and  so ofoccasionally calling on a neighbour.'     'If you can get out  on to the balcony,  you  can escape. Or is it highup?' Ivan was interested.     'No,' the guest replied firmly, 'I cannot escape from here, not becauseit's high up, but because I have nowhere to escape to.' And  he added, aftera pause: 'So, here we sit.'     'Here  we sit,'  Ivan replied,  peering into the man's  brown and  veryrestless eyes.     'Yes .  .  .' here the guest suddenly became alarmed,  'but you're  notviolent, I hope? Because, you know, I cannot stand noise, turmoil, force, orother things like that. Especially hateful to me are people's cries, whethercries of  rage, suffering, or anything else. Set me at ease, tell me, you'renot violent?'     'Yesterday  in  a  restaurant  I  socked  one  type  in the  mug,'  thetransformedpoet courageously confessed.     'Your grounds?' the guest asked sternly.     "No grounds, I must confess,' Ivan answered, embarrassed.     'Outrageous,' the  guest denounced Ivan and added: 'And besides, what away to express yourself: "socked  in the mug" ...  It is not known preciselywhether a man  has a mug or a  face. And, after all,  it may well be a face.So, you know, using fists ... No, you should give that up, and for good.'     Having thus reprimanded Ivan, the guest inquired:     'Your profession?'     'Poet,' Ivan confessed, reluctantly for some reason.     The visitor became upset.     'Ah, just my luck!' he exclaimed, but at once reconsidered, apologized,and asked: 'And what is your name?'     'Homeless.'     'Oh-oh .. .' the guest said, wincing.     'What, you mean you dislike my poetry?' Ivan asked with curiosity.     'I dislike it terribly.'     'And what have you read.'     'I've never read any of your poetry!' the visitor exclaimed nervously.     Then how can you say that?'     'Well,what of it?' the guest replied. 'As if I haven't read others. Orelse  .. .  maybe there's some miracle? Very well, I'm ready to take  it  onfaith. Is your poetry good? You tell me yourself.'     'Monstrous!' Ivan suddenly spoke boldly and frankly.     'Don't write any more!' the visitor asked beseechingly.     'I promise and I swear!' Ivan said solemnly.     The  oath  was sealed with a handshake,  and  here soft  footsteps  andvoices were heard in the corridor.     'Shh!' the guest whispered and,  jumping out to the balcony, closed thegrille behind him.     Praskovya  Fyodorovna  peeked  in, asked Ivan how he  was  feeling  andwhether he wished  to sleep in the dark or  with a light. Ivan  asked her toleave the light on, and Praskovya Fyodorovna withdrew, wishing the patient agood night. And when everything was quiet, the guest came back again.     He informed Ivan in a whisper that  there was a new arrival in room 119-- some  fat man with a  purple  physiognomy,  who kept muttering  somethingabout  currency in the  ventilation and swearing that unclean  powers  wereliving in their place on Sadovaya.     'He curses Pushkin up and down and keeps shouting: "Kurolesov,  encore,encore!"' the guest said, twitching nervously. Having calmed himself, he satdown,  said: 'Anyway, God  help him,'  and continued  his  conversation withIvan: 'So, how did you wind up here?'     'On account of Pontius  Pilate,'  Ivan replied, casting  a glum look atthe floor.     'What?!'  the guest cried, forgetting all caution, and clapped his handover  his own mouth. 'A staggering coincidence! Tell me about it, I beg you,I beg you!'     Feeling  trust  in  the  unknown  man  for  some  reason,  Ivan  began,falteringly  and timorously  at first,  then more boldly, to tell about  theprevious day's  story  at the  Patriarch's  Ponds. Yes,  it  was  a gratefullistener that  Ivan  Nikolaevich  acquired in the person  of  the mysteriousstealer  of keys! The guest did not  take Ivan for a madman, he showed greatinterest in what  he  was beingtold, and, as  the  story developed, finallybecame ecstatic. Time and again he interrupted Ivan with exclamations:     'Well, well, go on, go  on, I beg you! Only,  in the name of all that'sholy, don't leave anything out!'     Ivan left nothing out in any  case, it was easier for  him  to tell  itthat  way,  and he  gradually  reached the moment when Pontius  Pilate, in awhite mantle with blood-red lining, came out to the balcony.     Then the visitor put his hands together prayerfully and whispered:     'Oh, how I guessed! How I guessed it all!'     The  listener  accompanied the  description of Berlioz's terrible deathwith an enigmatic remark, while his eyes flashed with spite:     'I only regret  that  it  wasn't  the  critic  Latunsky  or the  writerMstislav Lavrovich instead of this  Berlioz!', and  he cried  out frenziedlybut soundlessly: 'Go on!'     The  cat  handing  money  to  the  woman  conductor  amused  the  guestexceedingly,  and he choked with quiet laughter watching as Ivan, excited bythe  successof his narration, quietly hopped on  bent legs, portraying  thecat holding the coin up next to his whiskers.     'And  so,'  Ivan concluded, growing  sad  and melancholy  after tellingabout the events at Griboedov's, 'I wound up here.'     The guest sympathetically placed a hand on the poor poet's shoulder andspoke thus:     'Unlucky poet! But you yourself,  dear heart, are to blame for it  all.You oughtn't to have behaved so casually and even impertinently with him. Soyou've paid  for  it. And  you  must still  say thank you  that you got  offcomparatively cheaply.'     'But who is he, finally?' Ivan asked, shaking his fists in agitation.     The guest peered at Ivan and answered with a question:     'You're  not going to get  upset? We're  all  unreliable here ... Therewon't be any calling for the doctor, injections, or other fuss?'     'No, no!' Ivan exclaimed. 'Tell me, who is he?'     'Very well,' the visitor replied, and he said weightily and distinctly:     "Yesterday at the Patriarch's Ponds you metSatan.'     Ivan did not get upset, as he had  promised, but even so he was greatlyastounded.     'That can't be! He doesn't exist!'     'Good  heavens! Anyone  else might say  that,  but not  you.  You  wereapparently one  of  his  first  victims. You're  sitting,  as  you  yourselfunderstand, in  a psychiatric clinic, yet you keep saying  he doesn't exist.Really, it's strange!'     Thrown off, Ivan fell silent.     'As soon as you started describing him,' the guest went on, 'I began torealize who it was that you had the pleasure of talking with yesterday. And,really, I'm  surprised  at  Berlioz!  Now  you,  of course,  are a  virginalperson,'  here  the  guest apologized again, 'but  that  one, from what I'veheard  about him,  had  after all read at least  something! The  very  firstthings  this  professor said dispelled  all my  doubts.  One can't  fail  torecognize him,  my friend! Though  you . .. again I  must apologize, but I'mnot mistaken, you are an ignorant man?'     'Indisputably,' the unrecognizableIvan agreed.     'Well, so  ... even  the face, as you described it, the different eyes,the eyebrows! . .. Forgive me, however, perhaps you've never even heard  theopera Faust?      Ivan became terribly embarrassed for some reason and, his face  aflame,began mumbling something about some trip to a sanatorium ... to Yalta . . .     'Well, so, so ... hardly surprising! But Berlioz, I repeat, astounds me... He's  not only a well-read man but also a very shrewd one. Though I mustsay in his defence that Woland is, of course, capable  of pulling  the  woolover the eyes of an even shrewder man.'     'What?!' Ivan cried out in his turn.     'Hush!'     Ivan slapped himself roundly on the forehead with his palm and rasped:     'I see, I see. He had the letter "W" on his visiting card.  Ai-yai-yai,what a thing!' He lapsed into a bewildered silence for some time, peering atthe moon floating  outside the  grille, and then  spoke:  'So that means  hemight actually have been at Pontius Pilate's? He was already born then? Andthey call me a madman!' Ivan added indignantly, pointing to the door.     A bitter wrinkle appeared on the guest's lips.     'Let's  look the truth  in  the  eye.'  And the guest  turned  his facetowards the nocturnal luminary racing through  a cloud.  'You and I are bothmadmen, there's  no denying  that!  You see, he shocked  you -  and you cameunhinged, since  you evidently had the ground prepared  for it. But what youdescribe undoubtedly  took place in reality. But  it's so extraordinary thateven Stravinsky, a psychiatrist of genius, did  not, of course, believe you.Did he examine you?' (Ivan  nodded.) 'Your interlocutor was at Pilate's, andhad breakfast with Kant, and now he's visiting Moscow.'     'But he'll  be up to devil knows  what  here! Oughtn't we to catch  himsomehow?' the  former,  not yet  definitively quashed Ivan still raised  hishead, though without much confidence, in the new Ivan.     'You've already tried, and  that  will do for you,'  the  guest repliedironically. 'I don't adviseothers  to try  either. And as for being  up  tosomething, rest  assured,  he will be! Ah, ah! But how annoying  that it wasyou who met him and not I. Though  it's all  burned up,  and  the coals havegone  to  ashes,  still,  I  swear,  for  that meeting  I'd  give  PraskovyaFyodorovna's bunch of keys, for I have nothing else to give. I'm destitute.'     'But what do you need him for?'     The  guest paused  ruefully  for a long time and  twitched, but finallyspoke:     'YOU  see,  it's  such a  strange story, I'm sitting here  for the samereason  you  are -  namely, on  account of  Pontius Pilate.' Here  the guestlooked around fearfully and said: The  thing is that  a  year  ago I wrote anovel about Pilate.'     'You're a writer?' the poet asked with interest.     The guest's face darkened and he threatened  Ivan  with his fist,  thensaid:     'I  am a  master.'  He  grew stern  and  took  from  the pocket  of hisdressing-gown a completely greasy black cap with  the letter 'M' embroideredon it in yellow silk.He put this cap on  and showed himself to Ivan both inprofile and full face, to prove that he was a  master. 'She  sewed it for mewith her own hands,' he added mysteriously.     'And what is your name?'     'I no  longer  have  a  name,'  the strange guest answered  with gloomydisdain.  'I  renounced  it, as I  generally  did everything  in life. Let'sforget it.'     Then at least tell me about the novel,' Ivan asked delicately.     'If you please,  sir. My life, it must be  said, has  taken  a not veryordinary course,' the guest began.     ...  A historian by education, he had worked until two years ago at oneof the Moscow museums, and, besides that, had also done translations.     'From what languages?' Ivan interrupted curiously.     'I know  five languages  besides my own,' replied the guest,  'English,French, German, Latin and Greek. Well, I can also read Italian a little.'     'Oh, my!' Ivan whispered enviously.     . .  . The historian had lived solitarily,  had no family anywhere  andalmost no acquaintancesin Moscow. And, just think, one day he won a hundredthousand roubles.     'Imagine my  astonishment,' the guest in the black cap whispered, 'whenI put my hand in the basket of dirty laundry and, lo and  behold, it had thesame number as in the newspaper. A state bond,'' he explained, 'they gave itto me at the museum.'     .. .  Having won a  hundred  thousand roubles, Ivan's mysterious  guestacted thus: bought books, gave up his room on Myasnitskaya .. .     'Ohh, that accursed hole! . . .' he growled.     . . . and rented from a builder, in a lane near the Arbat, two rooms inthe basement of a little house in the garden. He left his work at the museumand began writing a novel about Pontius Pilate.     'Ah, that was a golden age!' the narrator whispered,  his eyes shining.'A  completely private little  apartment,  plus  a front hall with a sink init,' he underscored for some reason with special pride, 'little windows justlevel  with the paved walk leading  from the gate. Opposite, only four stepsaway, near the fence,lilacs, a linden and a maple. Ah, ah, ah! In winter itwas very seldom  that I saw someone's black feet through my window and heardthe snow crunching under them. And in my stove a fire was eternally blazing!But suddenly spring came and through the dim glass I saw lilac bushes, nakedat first,  then  dressing  themselves  up  in green.  And it was  then, lastspring, that  something  happened far more delightful than getting a hundredthousand roubles. And that, you must agree, is a huge sum of money!'     That's true,' acknowledged the attentively listening Ivan. 'I opened mylittle windows and sat in the second, quite minuscule room.' The guest beganmeasuring with his arms: 'Here's the sofa, and another sofa  opposite, and alittle  table  between them,  with a  beautiful night lamp on  it, and booksnearer the window, and here a small writing table, and in the  first room --a  huge  room, one hundred and  fifty square feet! --  books, books and  thestove.  Ah, what furnishings I  had! The extraordinary smell of the lilacs!And my head was getting light with fatigue, and Pilate was flying to the end. . .'     'White mantle,  red  lining! I understand!' Ivan exclaimed.  'Preciselyso! Pilate  was flying to the end,  to the end,  and I already knew that thelast words of the novel would be: ". . . the fifth procurator  of Judea, theequestrian Pontius Pilate". Well, naturally, I  used to go out for a walk. Ahundred thousand is a huge sum, and I  had an  excellent suit. Or I'd go andhave  dinner  in some cheap restaurant. There was a wonderful  restaurant onthe Arbat, I don't know whether it exists now.' Here the guest's eyes openedw^de, and he  went on  whispering,  gazing  at the  moon:  'She was carryingrepulsive, alarming yellow  flowers in her  hand. Devil knows  what  they'recalled, but for some reason they're the first to appear in Moscow. And theseflowers  stood out clearly  against her black spring  coat. She was carryingyellow flowers! Not a nice colour. She turned down a lane from Tverskaya andthen looked back.Well, you know Tverskaya! Thousands of people were walkingalong Tverskaya, but I can assure you that  she saw me alone, and looked notreally alarmed, but even  as if in pain. And I was struck not so much by herbeauty as  by an extraordinary loneliness  in  her eyes,  such as no one hadever seen  before! Obeying this yellow sign, I also turned down the lane andfollowed her.  We  walked along the  crooked, boring lane silendy, I  on oneside, she on the other.  And,  imagine, there  was not a soul in the lane. Iwas suffering,  because it seemed  to  me that it  was necessary to speak toher, and I worried that I wouldn't utter a single word, and she would leave,and I'd never see her again. And, imagine, suddenly she began to speak:     ' "Do you like my flowers?"     'I remember clearly the sound other voice, rather low,  slightly husky,and, stupid as  it is,  it seemed that the echo  resounded  in  the lane andbounced off the dirty yellow wall. I quickly crossed to her side and, comingup to her, answered:    '"No!"     'She looked at me in surprise, and I suddenly,  and quite unexpectedly,understood that all my life I had loved precisely this woman! Quite a thing,eh? Of course, you'll say I'm mad?'     'I won't say anything,' Ivan exclaimed, and added: 'I beg you, go on!'     And the guest continued.     'Yes, she looked at  me  in  surprise, and  then, having  looked, askedthus:     '"You generally don't like flowers?"     'It seemed to me there was hostility in her voice. I was walking besideher, trying to  keep  in step, and,  to my surprise,  did not feel the leastconstraint.     ' "No, I like flowers, but not this kind," I said.     '"Which, then?"     '"I like roses."     'Then I regretted having said it, because she smiled guiltily and threwthe flowers into the gutter.  Slightly at a loss, I nevertheless picked themup and gave them to her, but she, with a smile, pushed the flowers away, andI carried them in my hand.     'So we  walked silently for some time,until she  took the flowers frommy  hand and threw them to  the pavement, then put her own  hand in a  blackglove with a bell-shaped cuff under my arm, and we walked on side by side.'     'Go on,' said Ivan, 'and please don't leave anything out!'     'Go on?' repeated the visitor. 'Why, you can guess  for yourself how itwent on.'  He  suddenly wiped  an  unexpected tear with his right sleeve andcontinued: 'Love  leaped out  in front  of us like  a murderer in  an  alleyleaping out of nowhere, and struck us both at once. As lightning strikes, asa Finnish knife strikes! She, by the way, insisted afterwards that it wasn'tso, that we had, of course, loved each other  for a long, long time, withoutknowing  each other, never having seen each other, and  that she  was livingwith a different man ... as I was,  too, then .. . with that, what's her . ..'     'With whom?' asked Homeless.     With that.  . .  well. . . with .. .'  replied the  guest, snapping hisfingers.     'YOU were married?'     'Why,  yes,  that's  whyI'm snapping  .. .  With that  ... Varenka ...Manechka . . . no, Varenka ... striped dress, the museum ... Anyhow, I don'tremember.     'Well, so she  said she  went out  that day with yellow flowers  in herhand  so that I would find her at last, and that if  it hadn't happened, shewould have poisoned herself, because her life was empty.     'Yes, love struck us instantly. I knew it that same day, an hour later,when,  without having noticed  the city,  we found  ourselves by the Kremlinwall on the embankment.     We talked as if we had parted only the  day before, as if we  had knowneach other  for many years. We arranged to  meet  the  next day  at the sameplace  on  the Moscow River, and we did. The  May sun shone down on us.  Andsoon, very soon, this woman became my secret wife.     'She used to come to  me every afternoon, but I would begin waiting forher in the morning.  This waiting expressed itself in the  moving around  ofobjects  on the table. Ten minutes  before, I  would sit  down by the littlewindowand begin to  listen  for the banging of  the decrepit gate.  And howcurious: before  my meeting with her, few people came  to  our  yard -- moresimply, no  one  came -- but now it seemed to me that  the  whole  city cameflocking there.     'Bang goes the  gate, bang goes my heart, and, imagine, it's inevitablysomebody's  dirty  boots  level  with  my   face   behind   the  window.   Aknife-grinder. Now, who needs a knife-grinder in our house? To sharpen what?What knives?     'She would come through the gate once, but my heart would pound no lessthan ten  times before that, I'm not lying. And then, when her hour came andthe hands showed  noon, it even wouldn't stop pounding until, almost withouttapping, almost noiselessly, her shoes would come even with my window, theirblack suede bows held tightly by steel buckles.     'Sometimes she would get mischievous, pausing at the second window  andtapping the glass with her toe. That same instant  I would be at the window,but the shoe would be gone, the  black silk blockingthe light would be gone-- I'd go and open the door for her.     'No  one knew  of  our liaison,  I assure you of that, though  it neverhappens. Her husband didn't know, her acquaintances  didn't know. In the oldhouse where I had that  basement, people knew, of course, they saw that somewoman visited me, but they didn't know her name.'     'But  who is she?' asked Ivan, intrigued  in the highest degree by thislove story.     The  guest made a gesture signifying  that he would never tell that  toanyone, and went on with his story.     Ivan learned that the master and the  unknown woman loved each other sodeeply that they  became  completely inseparable. Ivan could clearly pictureto himself  the two  rooms in the basement of the house, where it was alwaystwilight because  of the lilacs and the fence. The  worn  red furniture, thebureau, the clock on it which struck every half hour, and books, books, fromthe painted floor to the sooty ceiling, and the stove.     Ivan  learned that his  guest and his secret wife, from the very firstdays  of their  liaison,  had  come to the conclusion  that  fate itself hadthrown them together at the corner of Tverskaya and that lane, and that theyhad been created for each other for all time.     Ivan learned from the guest's story how the lovers would spend the day.She would come, and  put on an  apron first thing,  and  in the narrow fronthall  where  stood that  same  sink of which the poor patient  was  for somereason so proud, would light the kerosene stove on the wooden table, preparelunch, and  set it out  on  the oval table in  the first  room. When the Maystorms   came  and  water  rushed  noisily  through  the  gateway  past  thenear-sighted windows, threatening to flood  their last  refuge,  the  loverswould light the stove and bake potatoes in it. Steam rose from the potatoes,the  black  potato skins  dirtied  their  fingers.  Laughter  came from  thebasement,  the trees  in  the  garden after rain  shed broken  twigs,  whiteclusters.     When  the  storms  ended and  sultry summercame, there appeared in thevase  the long-awaited roses they both  loved. The  man who called himself amaster worked  feverishly  on  his  novel, and this novel  also absorbed theunknown woman.     'Really, there were times when I'd begin to be jealous of it on accountof her,' the night visitor come from the moonlit balcony whispered to Ivan.     Her  slender fingers with  sharply filed nails buried in her  hair, sheendlessly reread what he had  written,  and  after rereading  it  would  sitsewing that very same cap. Sometimes she crouched down by  the lower shelvesor stood  by  the upper ones and  wiped  the hundreds of dusty spines with acloth. She foretold fame, she urged him on, and it  was then that she  beganto call him  a master.  She waited impatiently for the already promised lastwords about  the fifth procurator ofJudea,  repeated aloud  in  a  sing-songvoice certain phrases she liked, and said that her life was in this novel.     It  was finished in  the month  of  August, was  given to some  unknowntypist,and she typed it in five copies. And finally  the  hour came when hehad to leave his secret refuge and go out into life.     'And  I went  out  into life holding  it in my hands, and then my  lifeended,'  the master whispered  and  drooped his  head, and for  a long  timenodded the woeful black cap with the yellow letter  'M' on it.  He continuedhis story, but it became somewhat incoherent, one could only understand thatsome catastrophe had then befallen Ivan's guest.     'For the first time I found myself in the world of literature, but now,when  it's  all over  and my ruin  is  clear, I recall it with horror!'  themaster  whispered  solemnly and  raised  his  hand.  'Yes,  he  astounded megreatly, ah, how he astounded me!'     'Who?' Ivan whispered barely audibly, fearing to interrupt the agitatednarrator.     'Why, the editor, I tell you, the editor! Yes, he read it all right. Helooked at me as if I  had a swollen  cheek, looked sidelong into the corner,and even  tittered  in embarrassment. He crumpled  themanuscript needlesslyand grunted. The questions he asked seemed crazy to me. Saving nothing aboutthe essence of the novel, he asked me who I was, where I came from,  and howlong  I  had been writing, and why no one  had heard of  me before, and evenasked  what in  my opinion was a totally idiotic question: who had given  methe  idea  of writing a novel on such a strange theme? Finally I got sick ofhim and  asked directly whether  he would publish the novel or not. Here  hestarted squirming, mumbled something, and  declared that he could not decidethe question  on his own, that other members  of the editorial board  had toacquaint themselves  with my work -- namely, the cridcs Latunsky and Ariman,and the writer  Mstislav Lavrovich.[2] He asked me to come in twoweeks. I  came in two  weeks and was  received by  some girl whose eyes werecrossed towards her nose from constant lying.'     That's Lapshennikova, the editorial secretary,' Ivan said with a smirk.He knew very well the world described so wrathfully by hisguest.     'Maybe,'  the other  snapped,  'and so  from  her I got my novel  back,already quite greasy and dishevelled. Trying to avoid looking me in the eye,Lapshennikova told me that the publisher was provided with material for  twoyears ahead, and therefore the question of printing my novel, as she put it,"did not arise".     'What  do  I remember  after  that?' the  master muttered,  rubbing histemple. 'Yes, red petals strewn across  the tide page,  and also the eyes ofmy friend. Yes, those eyes I remember.'     The story of Ivan's guest was becoming more confused, more filled  withall  sorts of reticences. He said something about  slanting rain and despairin  the basement  refuge,  about having  gone  elsewhere. He  exclaimed in awhisper that he did not blame her in the  least for pushing him to fight  --oh, no, he did not blame her!     Further on,  as Ivan  heard, something sudden and strange happened. Oneday our  hero  opened  a newspaper  and  saw  in it an article by the criticAriman,[3] inwhich  Ariman  warned all and sundry that  he, thatis, our hero, had attempted to foist into print an apology for Jesus Christ.     'Ah, I remember, I remember!' Ivan cried out.  'But I've forgotten yourname!'     'Let's leave my name out of it, I repeat, it no longer exists,' repliedthe guest. 'That's not the point. Two days  later in another newspaper, overthe  signature of Mstislav Lavrovich, appeared another article, in which itsauthor recommended striking,  and striking hard,  at  Pilatism  and  at  theicon-dauber who had  ventured to foist  it  (again that accursed word!) intoprint.     'Dumbfounded by  this  unheard-of  word "Pilatism",  I  opened  a thirdnewspaper.  There were two articles in it, one by Latunsky, the other signedwith  the  initials  "N.E." I assure you, the works  of Ariman and Lavrovichcould be counted  as jokes compared with what Latunsky wrote. Suffice it  tosay    that   Latunsky's   article    was   entitled    "A   Militant    OldBeliever".[4] I got so carried away  reading  the article  aboutmyself that I didn't notice (I had  forgotten to lock the door) how she camein and stood before me with a wet umbrella in her hand and wet newspapers aswell. Her eyes flashed fire, her trembling hands were cold. First she rushedto kiss me, then, in a  hoarse voice, and  pounding the table with her fist,she said she would poison Latunsky.'     Ivan grunted somewhat embarrassedly, but said nothing.     'Joyless autumn days set in,' the guest went on. 'The monstrous failurewith  this  novel  seemed to have  taken out a part  of my soul. Essentiallyspeaking, I had nothing more to do, and I lived from one meeting with her tothe next. And it was at that time that something happened to me. Devil knowswhat, Stravinsky probably figured it out long ago. Namely, anguish came overme and certain forebodings appeared.     "The articles, please  note, did  not cease. I laughed  at the first ofthem. But the more of them that appeared,  the more my attitude towards themchanged.  Thesecond  stage was one of astonishment. Some  rare falsity  andinsecurity  could  be  sensed  literally in every line  of  these  articles,despite  their threatening  and confident  tone.  I had  the feeling,  and Icouldn't get rid of it, that the authors of  these articles were not  sayingwhat they wanted to say, and that their rage sprang precisely from that. Andthen, imagine, a third stage came - of fear. No, not fear of these articles,you understand, but fear of other things totally unrelated to them or to thenovel. Thus, for instance, I began to  be afraid of  the dark. In short, thestage of  mental illness came. It seemed to  me, especially as I was fallingasleep,  that  some  very  cold  and  pliant  octopus was stealing with  itstentacles immediately and directly towards my heart. And I had to sleep withthe light on.     'My beloved changed  very much (of course, I  never told  her about theoctopus,  but she  could see that  something was  going wrong with  me), shebecame thinner and paler, stopped laughing,and kept asking  me  to  forgiveher for  having advised  me to publish  an excerpt.  She said  I should dropeverything and go  to the south,  to the  Black Sea,  and spend all that wasleft of the hundred thousand on the trip.     'She was very insistent, and to avoid  an argument (something told me Iwas not to go to the Black Sea),  I promised her that I'd do it one of thosedays. But she said she would buy me  the ticket herself. Then I took out allmy money - that is, about ten thousand roubles - and gave it to her.     ' "Why so much?" she was surprised.     'I said something or  other about being afraid of thieves and asked herto keep the money until my  departure.  She  took it, put  it in her  purse,began kissing  me and saying that it would  be easier for her to die than toleave me alone in such a state, but that she was expected, that she must bowto necessity,  that she  would come the  next day. She begged  me  not to beafraid of anything.     'This was at dusk, in mid-October. And she left. Ilay down on die sofaand  fell asleep without turning on the light. I was awakened by die feelingdiat the octopus was there. Groping in the dark, I barely managed to turn onthe light. My pocket watch showed  two o'clock in the morning. I was fallingill  when I went to bed, and I woke up  sick.  It suddenly seemed to me thatthe autumn darkness would push through the glass and pour into the room, andI  would  drown in it  as in  ink. I got  up a  man  no longer in control ofhimself.  I cried out, the thought came to me of running to someone, even ifit was  my landlord upstairs. I  struggled widi myself like a  madman. I hadstrength enough to get to  the stove and start a fire  in it.  When die woodbegan to  crackle and  the  stove door  rattled, I seemed  to  feel  slighdybetter. I dashed to the front room, turned on die light diere, found a botdeof white wine, uncorked it and began drinking from the  botde.  This bluntedthe fear somewhat -- at  least enough to keep me from running to me landlord-- and  I  went backto me stove. I opened the little door, so that the heatbegan to burn my face and hands, and whispered:     ' "Guess that trouble has befallen me . . . Come, come, come!..."     'But no  one  came. The fire  roared  in the  stove, rain lashed at diewindows. Then the final thing happened. I took the  heavy manuscript  of thenovel and the draft notebooks from the desk drawer and started burning them.This was terribly  hard to do,  because written-on paper  burns  reluctandy.Breaking  my fingernails, I  tore  up the notebooks, stuck  them  verticallybetween the logs, and ruffled the pages  with the  poker. At times the ashesgot die best of me, choking the flames, but I  struggled with them, and  thenovel,  though stubbornly  resisting,  was nevertheless  perishing. Familiarwords flashed before  me,  the yellow climbed steadily up the pages, but thewords  still showed dirough it. They would vanish only when die paper turnedblack, and I finished diem off with die poker.     'Just  dien  someone  began  scratchingquiedy at the window.  My heartleaped, and having stuffed the last notebook into the fire, I rushed to openthe door. Brick  steps led up  from  die  basement to  the door on the yard.Stumbling, I ran up to it and asked quiedy:     ' "Who's there?"     'And that voice, her voice, answered:     'It's me...'     'I don't remember how I managed with the chain and hook. As soon as shestepped inside, she clung to me, trembling, all wet, her cheeks  wet and herhair uncurled. I could only utter the word:     ' "You . . . you? . . .", and my voice broke, and we ran downstairs.     'She  freed herself of her overcoat in  the front hall,  and we quicklywent into  the first room. With a soft cry, she pulled out of the stove withher bare hands and threw on to the floor the last of what was there, a sheafthat had caught fire from  below. Smoke filled  the room at once.  I stampedout  the  fire with  my  feet,  and  she  collapsed  on  the  sofa and  weptirrepressibly and convulsively.     'When she calmeddown, I said:     ' "I came to hate this novel, and I'm afraid. I'm ill. Frightened."     'She stood up and said:     ' "God, how sick  you are. Why is it, why? But I'll save you.  111 saveyou. What is all this?"     'I  saw  her eyes swollen widi  smoke and weeping, felt her  cold handsstroke my forehead.     '"I'll  cure you,  I'll cure  you," she  was  murmuring,  clutching  myshoulders. "You'll restore it. Why, why didn't I keep a copy?"     'She bared her teeth with rage, she said something else inarticulately.Then,  compressing  her  lips,  she  began to  collect  and  smoodi  out theburnt-edged pages. It was some chapter from die middle of the novel, I don'tremember which.  She  neady stacked die  pages, wrapped them in  paper, tiedthem   with  a  ribbon.  All  her  actions  showed  that  she  was  full  ofdetermination, and diat she had regained  control of herself. She asked  forwine and, having drunk it, spoke more calmly:     ' "This is  how one pays for lying,"she said, "and I don't want to lieany more. I'd stay with you right now,  but I'd radier not do it diat way. Idon't want it to  remain for  ever in his memory diat I ran away from him inthe middle of  the night. He's never done me any  wrong ... He  was summonedunexpectedly, there was a fire at the factory.     But he'll  be back soon. I'll talk with him tomorrow morning, I'll tellhim that I love  another  man and  come back to you for ever.  Or maybe  youdon't want that? Answer me."     '  "Poor dear, my poor dear," I  said to her. "I won't allow you  to doit. Things won't go well for me, and I don't want you to perish with me."     '  "Is that the only reason?"  she  asked, and brought her eyes dose tomine.     '"The only one."     'She became  terribly animated, she dung to me, put her arms  around myneck and said:     ' "I'm perishing with you. In the morning I'll be here."     'And so,  the last thing  I remember  from  my life is a strip of lightfrommy front  hall, and in that strip of light an uncurled strand  of hair,her beret  and her eyes filled with determination. I also remember the blacksilhouette in the outside doorway and the white package.     ' "I'd  see you home, but it's beyond my strength  to come  back alone.I'm afraid."     ' "Don't be afraid. Bear with it for a few hours. Tomorrow morning I'llbe here."     'Those  were  her  last words  in my life  ...  Shh! ...'  the  patientsuddenly interrupted himself  and raised a  finger. 'It's a restless moonlitnight tonight.'     He disappeared on to  the balcony. Ivan heard little  wheels roll  downthe corridor, someone sobbed or cried out weakly.     When everything grew still, the guest came back and announced that room120 had received  an occupant. Someone had been brought,  and he kept askingto be given back his head. The two interlocutors fell anxiously silent, but,having  calmed down, they returned to the interrupted story. The  guest  wasjust opening his  mouth, but the nightwas indeed a restless one. There werestill voices in the corridor, and the guest began to speak into Ivan's  ear,so softly that what he told  him  was known only to the poet, apart from thefirst phrase:     'A quarter of an hour  after  she  left me, there came  a knock  at  mywindow. . .'     What the patient whispered into Ivan's  ear evidently agitated him verymuch. Spasms repeatedly passed over his face. Fear and rage swam and flittedin his eyes. The narrator pointed his hand somewhere in the direction of themoon, which  had long  since left  the  balcony.  Only when  all sounds fromoutside ceased to reach them did the guest move away from Ivan and  begin tospeak more loudly:     'Yes, and so in  mid-January,  at night, in the same coat but with  thebuttons torn off,[5] I was huddled with cold in  my  little yard.Behind me were snowdrifts that hid the lilac bushes, and before me and below-  my little windows,  dimly lit, covered  with  shades. I bent  down to thefirst  of them and listened - a gramophone wasplaying in my rooms. That wasall I heard, but I could not see anything. I stood  there a while, then wentout  the gate to the lane. A blizzard  was frolicking in it. A dog,  dashingunder my feet, frightened me, and I ran  away from it to the other side. Thecold, and the fear that had become my constant companion, were driving me tofrenzy. I had nowhere to go, and the simplest thing, of course,  would  havebeen to throw myself under a  tram-car on the street where my lane came out.From far off  I could see  those light-filled, ice-covered  boxes  and  heartheir loathsome screeching in the frost.  But, my  dear neighbour, the wholething was that  fear  possessed  every cell of  my body. And,  just as I wasafraid of the dog, so I was afraid of the tram-car. Yes, there is no illnessin this place worse than mine, I assure you!'     'But  you could have let  her  know,' said Ivan, sympathizing  with thepoor patient. 'Besides, she has your money. She did keep it, of course?'     'You needn't doubt that, of course shekept it. But you evidently don'tunderstand me. Or, rather, I've lost the  ability I once  had for describingthings.  However, I'm not  very sorry about that, since I no longer have anyuse for it. Before her,' the guest reverently looked  out at the darkness ofthe  night, 'there  would  lie a letter from a  madhouse. How  can  one sendletters from such  an address ... a mental  patient? . .. You're  joking, myfriend! Make her unhappy? No, I'm not capable of that.'     Ivan was unable to object to this, but the silent Ivan sympathized withthe guest,  he commiserated with him.  And  the other, from  the pain of hismemories, nodded his head in the black cap and spoke thus:     'Poor woman . .. However, I have hopes that she has forgotten me .. .'     'But you may recover.. .' Ivan said timidly.     'I am incurable,' the guest replied  calmly.  'When Stravinsky says  hewill bring me  back to life, I don't believe  him. He is  humane  and simplywants to comfort me.  I don't deny, however, that I'm  much better now. Yes,sowhere did I leave  off? Frost,  those flying trams  ... I knew that  thisclinic had been opened, and set  out for it on foot across the entire  city.Madness! Outside  the city I probably would have frozen to death, but chancesaved me.  A truck had broken down,  I came  up to the  driver, it was  somethree miles beyond the city limits, and to my surprise he  took pity  on me.The truck was coming here. And he took me  along. I got away with having  myleft toes frostbitten. But they cured that. And now this is the fourth monththat I've been here. And,  you know,  I find  it not at  all  bad here.  Onemustn't make  grandiose plans,  dear neighbour,  really!  I,  for  instance,wanted to go all around the globe. Well, so it turns out that I'm not  goingto do it. I see  only an insignificant piece of that  globe.  I suppose it'snot the very best there is on it, but, I repeat, it's not  so bad. Summer iscoming,  the  ivy will  twine up on to the  balcony. So Praskovya Fyodorovnapromises. The keys have broadened my  possibilities.There'll be the moon atnight. Ah, it's gone! Freshness. It's falling past midnight. Time to go.'     Tell me, what happened afterwards with  Yeshua and Pilate?' Ivan asked.'I beg you, I want to know.'     'Ah, no, no,' the guest replied with a painful twitch. 'I cannot recallmy novel without trembling. And your acquaintance from the Patriarch's Pondswould do it better than I. Thank you for the conversation. Goodbye.'     And  before Ivan  could collect his  senses, the grille  closed  with aquiet clang, and the guest vanished.
CHAPTER 14. Glory to the Cock!        His nerves gave out, as they say, and Rimsky fled to his office  beforethey finished drawing  up the report.  He sat  at his  desk and  stared withinflamed eyes at  the magic banknotes  lying before  him. The  findirector'swits were addled. A steady  hum came  from  outside. The  audience poured instreams  from  the  Variety building  into  the  street.  Rimsky's extremelysharpened hearing  suddenly caught the distant trill of a policeman. That initself  never  bodes anything pleasant. But  when it  was  repeated and,  toassist  it, another joined in, more authoritative and prolonged, and to themwas added a clearly audible guffawing and even some hooting, the findirectorunderstood at once that  something else scandalous  and vile had happened inthe street. And that, however much he wanted to wave it away, it was closelyconnected with  the repulsive seance presented by the black magician and hisassistants.     The keen-eared findirector was not mistaken in the least. As soon as hecast a  glance out the window on to Sadovaya, his face  twisted, and he didnot whisper but hissed:     'So I thought!'     In  the bright glare of the  strongest street lights he saw, just belowhim on  the sidewalk, a  lady in nothing  but  a  shift and violet bloomers.True, there  was a little hat on  the lady's head  and  an  umbrella  in herhands. The lady,  who was in a state  of utter consternation,  now crouchingdown, now making as if  to run off somewhere, was surrounded by an  agitatedcrowd, which produced the very guffawing that  had  sent a  shiver down  thefin-director's  spine. Next  to  the lady  some  citizen was flitting about,trying . to tear off his summer coat, and in his agitation simply  unable tomanage the sleeve in which his arm was stuck.     Shouts and roaring guffaws came from yet another  place  -- namely, theleft entrance - and turning his head in that  direction,  Grigory Danilovichsaw a  second lady,  in pink underwear.  She  leaped from the street to  thesidewalk,  striving  to  hide in  the hallway, but the audience pouring outblocked the way,  and the poor victim  other own flightiness and passion fordressing up, deceived by vile  Fagott's firm,  dreamed of only one thing  --falling  through  the earth. A  policeman  made for  the  unfortunate woman,drilling the  air with his  whisde,  and  after the policeman hastened  somemerry young men in caps. It was they who produced the guffawing and hoodng.     A skinny, moustachioed  cabby flew  up to the first undressed woman anddashingly  reined  in his  bony, broken-down nag.  The  moustached face  wasgrinning gleefully.     Rimsky  beat  himself on the  head with his fist, spat, and leaped backfrom the  window. For some time he sat at his desk listening to the  street.The whistling  at  various points reached its highest  pitch, then  began tosubside.  The scandal,  to Rimsky's  surprise,  was somehow liquidated  withunexpected swiftness.     It came time to act. He had to drink  the bitter cup of responsibility.The telephones  had been repaired  during  thethird  part. He had  to  makecalls, to tell what had happened, to  ask for  help, lie his  way out of it,heap everything  on  Likhodeev,  cover up for himself, and so  on. Pah,  thedevil!     Twice the upset director  put  his  hand  on the receiver, and twice hedrew it back. And suddenly, in the dead silence of the office, the telephoneburst out ringing by itself right in  the findirector's face, and he  gave astart and went cold. 'My nerves are really upset, though!'  he  thought, andpicked up the receiver. He recoiled from it instantly and turned whiter thanpaper.  A  soft  but  at  the same time insinuating  and  lewd female  voicewhispered into the receiver:     'Don't call anywhere, Rimsky, it'll be bad . ..'     The  receiver straight away went  empty. With goose-flesh prickling  onhis back, the findirector hung up  the telephone and  for some reason turnedto look  at the  window  behind  him.  Through the scant  and  still  barelygreening branches of a maple, he saw the moon racing in a transparent cloud.His eyes fixed  on the  branches for some reason, Rimsky went  on gazing atthem, and the longer he gazed, the more strongly he was gripped by fear.     With great effort, the findirector finally turned away from the moonlitwindow  and stood up. There could no  longer be any question of phone calls,and now the findirector was thinking of only one thing -- getting out of thetheatre as quickly as possible.     He listened: the theatre building  was  silent. Rimsky realized that hehad  long  been  the  only one on  the whole second  floor, and a  childish,irrepressible fear came over him at this thought. He could not think withoutshuddering  of having to  walk alone now along  the empty corridors and downthe stairs.  Feverishly  he seized the hypnotist's banknotes from the table,put them in his briefcase, and coughed so as to cheer himself  up at least alittle. The cough came out slightly hoarse, weak.     And here it  seemed  to  him that  a whiff of  some putrid dankness wascoming in  under the office  door. Shiversran down the findirector's spine.And  then the clock also rang out unexpectedly and began to strike midnight.And  even  its striking provoked  shivers  in the findirector. But his heartdefinitively sank when he heard the English  key turning quiedy in the lock.Clutching his briefcase  with damp, cold hands, the findirector felt that ifthis  scraping in the keyhole were to  go on any longer, he would break downand give a piercing scream.     Finally the door  yielded to someone's efforts, opened,  and  Varenukhanoiselessly  entered the  office. Rimsky simply sank down into  the armchairwhere he stood, because his legs gave  way. Drawing a deep breath, he smiledan ingratiating smile, as it were, and said quiedy:     'God, you frightened me . . .'     Yes, this sudden appearance might have frightened anyone  you like, andyet at the same time it was a great joy: at least one little  end peeped outin this tangled affair.     Well,  tell me quickly! Well? Well?' Rimsky wheezed,  grasping  at thislittle end. 'What doesit all mean?!'     'Excuse  me,  please,'  the  entering man replied  in a  hollow  voice,closing the door, 'I thought you had already left.'     And Varenukha,  without taking  his cap off, walked to the armchair andsat on the other side of the desk.     It must be said that Varenukha's response was marked by a slight odditywhich at once needled the findirector, who could compete in sensitivity withthe seismograph of any  of the world's best stations.  How could it be? W'lwdid Varenukha come to  the findirector's office if he  thought  he  was  notthere?  He had his own office, first of all. And  second, whichever entranceto the building Varenukha had used, he would inevitably  have met one of thenight-watchmen, to all of whom it had been announced that Grigory Danilovichwas staying  late in  his office. But  the findirector  did  not spend  longpondering this oddity - he had other problems.     'Why didn't you call? What are all these shenanigans about Yalta?'     "Well, it's as I was saying,' the administrator replied, sucking as ifhe were troubled by a bad tooth. 'He was found in the tavern in Pushkino.'     'In  Pushkino?! You mean just outside Moscow?! What about the telegramsfrom Yalta?!'     'The devil they're from Yalta! He got a telegrapher drunk in  Pushkino,and  the two  of them  started acting up, sending  telegrams marked "Yalta",among other things.'     'Aha ... aha ... Well, all right, all right.. .' Rimsky did not say butsang out.  His eyes lit up with a yellow light. In his head there formed thefestive picture  of Styopa's shameful  dismissal  from his job. Deliverance!The findirector's long-awaited deliverance from this  disaster in the personof Likhodeev!  And  maybe Stepan  Bogdanovich would achieve something  worsethan dismissal  . .. The details!' said Rimsky,  banging the paperweight  onthe desk.     And Varenukha began giving the details. As soon as he arrived where thefindirector had sent him, he was received at once and given a most attentivehearing.  No one, of course, even entertainedthe  thought that Styopa couldbe  in  Yalta. Everyone agreed  at once  with  Varenukha's  suggestion  thatLikhodeev was, of course, at the Yalta in Pushkino.     'Then  where  is he now?'  the  agitated  findirector  interrupted  theadministrator.     'Well,  where else  could he  be?' the administrator  replied, grinningcrookedly. 'In a sobering-up cell, naturally!'     'Well, well. How nice!'     Varenukha  went on  with  his story, and  the  more he  told, the  morevividly  there unfolded before the findirector the long chain of Likhodeev'sboorish and outrageous acts, and every link in this chain was worse than theone before. The  drunken dancing  in the arms of the telegrapher on the lawnin front of  the Pushkino telegraph office to the sounds of  some  itinerantbarrel-organ  was  worth  something!  The  chase after some female  citizensshrieking with terror! The attempt at a fight with the  barman in the  Yaltaitself! Scattering  green  onions  all  over the  floor of  the  same Yalta.Smashing  eight  bottlesof dry white  Ai-Danil. Breaking the meter when thetaxi-driver  refused to  take Styopa in his  cab. Threatening to  arrest thecitizens who attempted to stop  Styopa's obnoxiousness  ... In short,  blackhorror!     Styopa was well known in Moscow theatre circles, and everyone knew thatthe man was  no gift.  But all the  same, what the administrator was tellingabout  him was too much even for Styopa. Yes, too much. Even much too much ...     Rimsky's  needle-sharp  glance  pierced  the administrator's  face fromacross  the desk, and  the  longer the  man spoke,  the grimmer  those  eyesbecame. The  more lifelike  and  colourful  the  vile details with which theadministrator  furnished his story, the  less the  findirector  believed thestoryteller. And when Varenukha told how Styopa had let himself go so far asto try to resist those who came to bring him back to Moscow, the findirectoralready knew  firmly that everything the  administrator  who had returned atmidnight was telling him, everything, was a  lie! A liefrom first  word  tolast!     Varenukha never went to  Pushkino, and there was no Styopa in Pushkino.There was no drunken telegrapher, there  was no broken  glass in the tavern,Styopa did not get tied up with ropes ... none of it happened.     As  soon   as  the  findirector  became   firmly   convinced  that  theadministrator was lying to him, fear crept over his body, starting from  thelegs,  and  twice  again the  findirector fancied  that  a  putrid  malarialdankness was  wafting  across the  floor. Never for a moment taking his eyesoff the administrator  -- who squirmed somehow  strangely  in  his armchair,trying not to  get out  of the blue shade of the  desk  lamp, and  screeninghimself with a newspaper  in  some  remarkable  fashion from the  bothersomelight -- the findirector was thinking  of only one thing:  what did  it  allmean? Why was he  being lied  to  so brazenly,  in  the silent and  desertedbuilding,  by  the administrator who was so late in  coming back to him? Andthe awareness of danger,  anunknown but  menacing danger, began  to gnaw atRimsky's soul.  Pretending to ignore Varenukha's dodges and tricks with  thenewspaper, the findirector studied his face, now almost without listening tothe yarn Varenukha was spinning. There  was something that seemed still moreinexplicable  than the calumny invented.  God knows why, about adventures inPushkino,  and  that   something  was  the  change  in  the  administrator'sappearance and manners.     No matter how the  man pulled  the duck-like visor of his cap over  hiseyes,  so as to throw a shadow on his  face, no matter how he fidgeted  withthe newspaper, the findirector managed to make out an enormous bruise on theright  side  of  his  face  just  by the  nose.  Besides that, the  normallyfull-blooded administrator was now pale with a chalk-like, unhealthy pallor,and on  this stifling night  his neck was for  some reason wrapped in an oldstriped  scarf.  Add  to that  the repulsive manner  the  administrator  hadacquired during the rime of his  absence of sucking and smacking, the sharpchange in his voice, which had become hollow and coarse, and the furtivenessand cowardliness in his eyes, and one could boldly say that Ivan SavelyevichVarenukha had become unrecognizable.     Something else burningly troubled the findirector, but he was unable tograsp precisely what it  was, however much  he strained  his feverish  mind,however hard he peered at Varenukha. One thing he  could affirm, that  therewas  something   unprecedented,  unnatural  in   this  combination  of   theadministrator and the familiar armchair.     "Well, we finally overpowered him, loaded him into the car,'  Varenukhaboomed, peeking from behind the paper and covering the bruise with his hand.     Rimsky suddenly  reached  out and,  as  if  mechanically,  tapping  hisfingers on the table at the same time, pushed  the electric-bell button withhis palm and went numb.  The sharp signal ought to have been  heard  withoutfail  in  the  empty  building.  But no signal came,  and  the  button  sanklifelesslyinto the wood of the desk. The button was dead, the bell broken.     The findirector's stratagem did not escape the notice of Varenukha, whoasked, twitching, with a clearly malicious fire flickering in his eyes:     "What are you ringing for?'     'Mechanically,' the  findirector  replied  hollowly,  jerking  his handback, and asked in turn, in an unsteady voice: "What's that on your face?'     'The car skidded,  I bumped  against the door-handle,' Varenukha  said,looking away.     'He's lying!'  the findirector  exclaimed mentally.  And here  his eyessuddenly  grew round and utterly insane, and he stared  at  the back of  thearmchair.     Behind the chair  on the floor two shadows  lay  criss-cross, one  moredense and  black, the  other faint and grey. The  shadow of the back  of thechair and  of its tapering legs  could be seen distinctly on the floor,  butthere was  no shadow of Varenukha's head  above the back of the chair, or ofthe administrator's legs under its legs.     'He  casts no shadow!' Rimsky  cried out  desperately in his mind.  Hebroke into shivers.     Varenukha,  following Rimsky's insane gaze, looked furtively behind himat the back of the chair, and realized that he had been found out.     He got  up from the  chair (the findirector  did likewise) and made onestep back from the desk, clutching his briefcase in his hands.     'He's guessed, damn him! Always was  clever,' Varenukha said,  grinningspitefully right in the findirector's face, and he sprang unexpectedly  fromthe  chair to  the door  and quickly pushed down  the catch on the lock. Thefindirector  looked desperately behind  him,  as  he retreated to the windowgiving on to the garden, and in this window, flooded with moonlight, saw theface of a naked  girl pressed against the  glass and her naked arm  reachingthrough the vent-pane and trying  to open the lower latch. The upper one wasalready open.     It seemed  to Rimsky that the light of  the desk lamp was going out andthe desk was tilting. An icy wave engulfed Rimsky, but - fortunatelyfor him-- he got control of himself and did  not  fall. He had enough strength leftto whisper, but not cry out:     'Help .. .'     Varenukha, guarding the door,  hopped up and down by it, staying in airfor  a long  rime and swaying there.  Waving his hooked  fingers in Rimsky'sdirection, he hissed and smacked, winking to the girl in the window.     She began to hurry, stuck her red-haired head through the vent, reachedher arm  down as far as she could, her nails clawing at  the lower latch andshaking  the  frame.  Her  arm began  to  lengthen,  rubber-like, and becamecovered with a putrid green. Finally the dead woman's green fingers got holdof the latch knob, turned  it, and the frame began to open. Rimsky cried outweakly, leaned against the wall, and held his briefcase in front of him likea shield. He realized that his end had come.     The frame swung wide open, but instead of the night's freshness and thefragrance of the  lindens, the smell  of  a cellar burst into the room.  Thedead woman  stepped on to thewindow-sill. Rimsky clearly saw spots of decayon her breast.     And just then the joyful, unexpected crowing of  a cock  came  from thegarden,  from  that  low building  beyond the shooting  gallery  where birdsparticipating in  the  programme were kept. A  loud, trained cock trumpeted,announcing that dawn was rolling towards Moscow from the east.     Savage fury distorted the girl's face,  she emitted a hoarse oath,  andat the door Varenukha shrieked and dropped from the air to the floor.     The  cock-crow  was repeated, the girl  clacked  her teeth, and her redhair stood on end.  With  the third crowing of the cock, she turned and flewout  And  after her, jumping up and  stretching himself horizontally in  theair, looking like a flying cupid, Varenukha slowly floated over the desk andout the window.     White  as snow,  with not a single black hair on his head, the old  manwho still recently  had been  Rimsky  rushed to  the door,  undid the catch,opened the door, and ran hurtling down the dark corridor. Atthe turn to thestairs, moaning with fear, he felt for the switch, and the stairway  lightedup. On the stairs the shaking, trembling old  man  fell because  he imaginedthat Varenukha had softly tumbled on top of him.     Having  run downstairs,  Rimsky saw a watchman asleep on a chair by thebox office in the lobby. Rimsky stole past him on tiptoe and  ' slipped  outthe main entrance. Outside he felt slighdy better. He  recovered his  sensesenough to realize, clutching his head, that his hat had stayed behind in theoffice.     Needless to say, he did not go back for it, but, breathless, ran acrossthe wide street to  the opposite corner  by the movie theatre, near which  adull  reddish light hovered. In a  moment he was there.  No one had time  tointercept the cab.     'Make  the Leningrad express, I'll tip you  well,' the  old  man  said,breathing heavily and clutching his heart.     'I'm going to  the  garage,' the driver  answered hatefully  and turnedaway.     Then Rimsky unlatched his briefcase, took out fiftyroubles, and handedthem to the driver through the open front window.     A few moments  later,  the rattling car  was flying  like the wind downSadovoye Ring.  The passenger  was  tossed about  on  his seat, and  in  thefragment of mirror  hanging  in front  of  the driver,  Rimsky saw  now  thedriver's happy eyes, now his own insane ones.     Jumping out of the car in front  of the train station, Rimsky cried  tothe first man he saw in a white apron with a badge:     'First class, single, I'll pay  thirty,' he  was pulling  the banknotesfrom  his briefcase, crumpling  them, 'no first  class, get me second ... ifnot -- a hard bench!'     The man with the badge kept glancing up at the lighted clock face as hetore the banknotes from Rimsky's hand.     Five  minutes later the express train disappeared from under  the glassvault of the train station and vanished clean away in the darkness. And withit vanished Rimsky.
CHAPTER I 5. Nikanor Ivanovich's Dream        It  is  not  difficult to  guess  that  the  fat man  with  the  purplephysiognomy who  was put  in  room 119 of the  clinic was  Nikanor IvanovichBosoy.     He  got to Professor Stravinsky  not at once,  however, but after firstvisiting  another  place.'  Of this other  place  little remained in NikanorIvanovich's memory. He recalled only a desk, a bookcase and a sofa.     There a conversation was held with Nikanor Ivanovich, who had some sortof haze before his eyes from the rush of blood and mental agitation, but theconversation came out somehow strange, muddled, or,  better to  say, did notcome out at all.     The very first question put to Nikanor Ivanovich was the following:     'Are you  Nikanor  Ivanovich Bosoy, chairman of the house  committee atno.502-bis on Sadovaya Street?'     To  this Nikanor  Ivanovich, bursting into  terrible  laughter, repliedliterally thus:     'I'm Nikanor, of  course I'm  Nikanor!  But  what  the  deuce  kind  ofchairman am I?'     'Meaning what?' the questionwas asked with a narrowing of eyes.     'Meaning,'  he  replied,  'that  if  I  was  chairman,  I  should  havedetermined at once that  he was an unclean power! Otherwise -- what is it? Acracked  pince-nez, all  in  rags ... what  kind of foreigner's  interpretercould he be?'     'Who are you talking about?' Nikanor Ivanovich was asked.     'Koroviev!'  Nikanor Ivanovich cried out. 'Got  himself lodged  in  ourapartment number fifty. Write it down - Koroviev! He must be caught at once.Write it down - the sixth entrance. He's there.'     'Where  did  you  get  the currency?' Nikanor Ivanovich was  asked soulfully.     'As God is true, as God is almighty,' Nikanor Ivanovich began, Tie seeseverything, and it serves me  right. I never laid a finger on it, never evensuspected what it was,  this currency! God is punishing me for my iniquity,'Nikanor Ivanovich  went on with feeling, now buttoning, now  unbuttoning hisshirt, now crossing himself. 'I took! I took, but I took ours. Soviet money!I'd  register  people formoney, I  don't  argue, it happened. Our secretaryBedsornev is a good  one, too, another good one!  Frankly speaking,  there'snothing but  thieves  in  the house  management  .  .  .  But I  never  tookcurrency!'     To the request that he stop  playing the fool and tell  how the dollarsgot into the ventilation, Nikanor Ivanovich went on  his  knees and  swayed,opening his mouth as if he meant to swallow a section of the parquet.     'If you  want,' he mumbled, 'I'll eat dirt that  I  didn't  do it!  AndKoroviev -- he's the devil!'     All patience has its limits, and the voice at the  desk was now raised,hinting  to Nikanor Ivanovich that it was time  he  began speaking in  humanlanguage.     Here  the room with that same sofa resounded  with Nikanor  Ivanovich'swild roaring, as he jumped up from his knees:     'There he  is!  There,  behind the  bookcase! He's  grinning!  And  hispince-nez . . . Hold him! Spray the room with holy water!'     The  blood left Nikanor Ivanovich's face. Trembling, he made crossesinthe  air, rushing to the  door  and back,  intoned some  prayer, and finallybegan spouting sheer gibberish.     It  became  perfectly clear that  Nikanor Ivanovich was unfit  for  anyconversation. He  was taken out and put in  a separate room, where he calmeddown somewhat and only prayed and sobbed.     They did, of course, go to Sadovaya and visit apartment no.50. But theydid not find any  Koroviev there, and no one in the house either knew or hadseen any Koroviev. The apartment occupied by the late Berlioz, as well as bythe  Yalta-visiting Likhodeev, was empty, and in  the  study wax  seals hungpeacefully  on  the  bookcases, unbroken  by anyone.  With  that  they  leftSadovaya,  and there also  departed with  them  the perplexed and dispiritedsecretary of the house management, Bedsornev.     In the evening Nikanor Ivanovich was delivered  to Stravinsky's clinic.There  he   became  so  agitated   that  an  injection,  made  according  toStravinsky's  recipe, had  to  be  given him,  and  only after  midnightdidNikanor  Ivanovich fall  asleep in  room 119,  every now and then emitting aheavy, painful moan.     But the  longer he  slept, the  easier  his  sleep  became.  He stoppedtossing and groaning, his breathing became easy and regular, and he was leftalone. Then Nikanor Ivanovich was visited by a dream,  at the basis of whichundoubtedly lay  the experience of that day. It began with Nikanor Ivanovichseeing as it  were some people with  golden trumpets in their  hands leadinghim, and very solemnly, to a big lacquered door. At this door his companionsplayed as  it were a nourish for Nikanor  Ivanovich, and then from the sky aresounding bass said merrily:     'Welcome, Nikanor Ivanovich, turn over your currency!'     Exceedingly astonished, Nikanor Ivanovich saw a black loudspeaker abovehim.     Then he found himself for some reason in a theatre house, where crystalchandeliers  blazed  under   a  gilded  ceiling  and  Quinquet  lamps[2]on the walls. Everything was as it ought to  be  in a small-sized butvery costlytheatre.  There was a  stage closed off by a velvet curtain, itsdark cerise  background spangled,  as  if  with  stars, with  oversized goldpieces, there was a prompter's box, and there was even an audience.     What surprised Nikanor Ivanovich was that  this audience was all of thesame sex  - male - and all  for some reason bearded.  Besides  that, it  wasstriking  that  there were no seats in the theatre, and the audience was allsitting on the floor, splendidly polished and slippery.     Abashed in this new and big  company, Nikanor Ivanovich,  after a briefhesitation,  followed  the  general  example  and  sat down  on the  parquetTurkish-fashion, huddled  between some stalwart, bearded redhead and anothercitizen, pale and quite overgrown. None of the sitters paid any attention tothe newly arrived spectator.     Here the soft ringing of a bell was heard, the lights in the house wentout, and the  curtain opened to reveal a lighted  stage  with an armchair, alittle  table  on  which stood  a  golden bell,  and a solid  black  velvetbackdrop.     An  artiste came  out  from the  wings in an  evening  jacket, smoothlyshaven,  his hair neatly parted, young and with  very pleasant features. Theaudience in the house livened up, and everyone turned towards the stage. Theartiste advanced to the prompter's box and rubbed his hands.     'All sitting?'[3] he asked in a soft baritone and smiled  tothe house. 'Sitting,  sitting,' a chorus of tenors and  basses answered fromthe house.     'Hm ..  .' the artiste began pensively, 'and how you're not sick of it.I just don't understand! Everybody else is out walking around  now, enjoyingthe spring sun  and the  warmth, and you're stuck in here on  the floor of astuffy theatre! Is  the programme so interesting?  Tastes  differ, however,'the artiste concluded philosophically.     Then he  changed both the  timbre of  his voice and its intonation, andannounced gaily and resoundingly:     'And  now for  the next number  on our  programme -- Nikanor  IvanovichBosoy, chairman of a  house committeeand  director of  a dietetic  kitchen.Nikanor Ivanovich, on-stage!'     General  applause greeted  the artiste. The surprised Nikanor Ivanovichgoggled his eyes, while the master of ceremonies,  blocking the glare of thefootlights  with  his  hand,  located him  among  the  sitters and  tenderlybeckoned  him  on-stage  with  his  finger.  And Nikanor  Ivanovich, withoutknowing how, found himself on-stage. Beams of coloured light struck his eyesfrom in front and below, which at once caused the house and the  audience tosink into darkness.     'Well,  Nikanor  Ivanovich, set  us  a  good example,  sir,' the  youngartiste said soulfully, 'turn over your currency.'     Silence ensued.  Nikanor Ivanovich took  a deep breath and quiedy beganto speak:     'I swear to God that I...'     But before he had time to get the words out, the whole house burst intoshouts of indignation. Nikanor Ivanovich got confused and fell silent.     'As far as I understand you,' said the programme announcer, 'you wantedto  swear  to  God that  you  haven't  got  any currency?',  and  he  gazedsympathetically at Nikanor Ivanovich.     'Exactly right, I haven't,' replied Nikanor Ivanovich.     'Right,' responded the artiste, 'and  .  . .  excuse the  indiscretion,where did the  four  hundred  dollars that  were found  in the privy  of theapartment of which you and your wife are the sole inhabitants come from?'     'Magic!' someone in the dark house said with obvious irony.     'Exactly right -- magic,' Nikanor Ivanovich  timidly  replied,  vaguelyaddressing either the artiste or the dark house, and he explained:     'Unclean powers, the checkered interpreter stuck me with them.'     And  again the house  raised an indignant  roar. When silence came, theartiste said:     'See what  La Fontaine fables I  have to listen to! Stuck him with fourhundred dollars! Now, all of you here are currency dealers, so I address youas experts: is that conceivable?'     We're  not  currency  dealers,' various  offended voices came  from thetheatre, 'but, no, it's notconceivable!'     'I'm entirely of the same mind,'  the artiste said firmly, 'and  let meask you: what is it that one can be stuck with?'     'A baby!' someone cried from the house.     'Absolutely  correct,' the  programme announcer confirmed, 'a baby,  ananonymous letter, a  tract, an infernal machine, anything  else, but no  onewill stick  you with four  hundred dollars, for  such  idiots don't exist innature.' And  turning to Nikanor Ivanovich,  the artiste added reproachfullyand sorrowfully: 'You've  upset me, Nikanor Ivanovich, and I was counting onyou. So, our number didn't come off.'     Whistles came from the house, addressed to Nikanor Ivanovich.     'He's a currency dealer,' they shouted from the house, 'and we innocentones have to suffer for the likes of him!'     'Don't  scold  him,'  the  master  of  ceremonies  said softly,  'he'llrepent.' And turning to  Nikanor Ivanovich, his blue eyes filled with tears,he added: 'Well, Nikanor Ivanovich, you may go to your place.'     After that the artiste rangthe bell and announced loudly:     'Intermission, you blackguards!'     The shaken Nikanor Ivanovich, who unexpectedly for himself had become aparticipant in some  sort  of theatre programme, again found himself  in hisplace  on  the  floor.  Here he dreamed that  the house was plunged in totaldarkness, and fiery red words leaped out on the walls:     Turn over your currency!' Then  the curtain opened again and the masterof ceremonies invited:     'I call Sergei Gerardovich Dunchil to the stage.'     Dunchil turned out to be a fine-looking but rather unkempt man of aboutfifty.     'Sergei  Gerardovich,' the master of ceremonies addressed  him, 'you'vebeen sitting here for a  month and a half now,  stubbornly refusing  to turnover the currency you still have,  while  the country  is in need of it, andyou  have  no  use  for  it  whatsoever.  And  still  you persist. You're anintelligent  man, you  understand it all perfectly  well, and  yet you don'twant to comply with me.'     To  my  regret, there  is  nothingI  can  do,  since  I have  no  morecurrency,' Dunchil calmly replied.     'Don't  you  at  least  have  some diamonds?'  asked the  artiste.  'Nodiamonds either.'     The  artiste hung  his  head and pondered,  then clapped his  hands.  Amiddle-aged lady came out from the wings, fashionably dressed -- that is, ina collarless coat  and  a tiny hat.  The  lady  looked  worried, but Dunchilglanced at her without moving an eyebrow.     'Who is this lady?' the programme  announcer asked Dunchil. 'That is mywife,' Dunchil replied with dignity and looked at the lady's long neck  witha certain repugnance.     We  have  troubled  you, Madame  Dunchil,'  the  master  of  ceremoniesadverted to the  lady, 'with regard to  the following: we wanted to ask you,does your husband have any more currency?'     'He  turned  it  all  over  the other  time,'  Madame  Dunchil  repliednervously.     'Right,' said the  artiste,  'well, then,  if it's so, it's  so.  If heturned  it  all  over,  then  we  ought  to  part  with  Sergei Gerardovichimmediately, there's nothing else to  do!  If you wish, Sergei  Gerardovich,you may leave the theatre.' And the artiste made a regal gesture.     Dunchil turned calmly and with dignity, and headed for the wings. 'Justa  moment!' the master of ceremonies stopped him.  'Allow me  on parting  toshow  you  one more number from our  programme.'  And  again  he clapped hishands.     The black backdrop parted, and on to the stage came a young beauty in aball gown, holding in her hands a golden  tray on which  lay a fat  wad tiedwith candy-box ribbon and a diamond necklace from which blue, yellow and redfire leaped in all directions.     Dunchil took a  step back and  his face  went  pale.  The  house froze.'Eighteen thousand dollars and a necklace worth forty thousand in gold,' theartiste solemnly announced,  'kept  by Sergei  Gerardovich  in  the city  ofKharkov,  in the apartment of his mistress,  Ida  Herkulanovna Vors, whom wehave the  pleasure  of seeing  here before us and  who  so kindly helped  indiscoveringthese treasures  -- priceless, vet  useless in the  hands  of  aprivate person. Many thanks, Ida Herkulanovna!'     The  beauty  smiled,  flashing  her  teeth,   and  her  lush  eyelashesfluttered. 'And under your so very dignified  mask,' the artiste adverted toDunchil, 'is  concealed  a  greedy spider and an astonishing  bamboozler andliar. You wore everyone out during  this month  and a half  with  your  dullobstinacy. Go home now, and let the hell your  wife  sets up for you be yourpunishment.'     Dunchil  swayed and, it seems, wanted to fall  down, but was held up bysomeone's sympathetic  hands. Here the  front  curtain dropped and concealedall those on-stage.     Furious applause shook the  house, so  much so  that Nikanor Ivano-vichfancied  the lights  were  leaping in the chandeLers. When the front curtainwent up,  there was  no one on-stage except the lone artiste. Greeted with asecond burst of applause, he bowed and began to speak:     'In the person  of this Dunchil, our programme has shown you  a typicalass. I  did have the pleasure  of saying  yesterday that  the concealing ofcurrency is senseless. No one  can make use of it under any circumstances, Iassure  you.  Let's  take this same Dunchil. He gets a  splendid salary  anddoesn't  want  for  anything.  He  has  a  splendid apartment, a wife and  abeautiful mistress. But no, instead of living quietly and peacefully withoutany troubles, having turned over  the  currency  and stones, this  mercenaryblockhead gets  himself  exposed in front of everybody,  and  to top  it offcontracts  major  family  trouble.  So,  who's  going  to  turn  over?   Anyvolunteers?  In that case,  for the  next number on our programme,  a famousdramatic  talent, the actor  Kurolesov, Sawa  Potapovich, especially invitedhere, will perform excerpts from The Covetous Knight  by the poet Pushkin.'     The promised Kurolesov  was not  slow in coming on stage and turned outto be a strapping and beefy man, clean-shaven,  in a tailcoat and white tie.Without any  preliminaries, he concocted a gloomy face, knitted  his brows,and began speaking in an  unnatural voice, glancing  sidelong at  the goldenbell:     'As  a  young scapegrace  awaits  a  tryst  with  some  sly  strumpet...'[5]     And Kurolesov  told many  bad things about  himself. Nikanor Ivano-vichheard Kurolesov  confess  that some wretched widow had gone on  her knees tohim, howling, in the rain, but had failed to move the actor's callous heart.     Before his dream, Nikanor Ivanovich had been completely ignorant of thepoet Pushkin's works, but the man himself he knew perfectly well and severaltimes a  day used to say phrases like: 'And who's  going to pay  the rent  -Pushkin?'[6] or Then who did unscrew the bulb  on the stairway --Pushkin?' or 'So who's going to buy the fuel -- Pushkin?'     Now,  having become acquainted with one of his works, Nikanor Ivanovichfelt  sad,  imagined the  woman on her knees, with her orphaned children, inthe rain, and involuntarily thought: "What a type, though, this Kurolesov!'     And the latter, ever raisinghis voice, went on with his confession andgot  Nikanor  Ivanovich definitively muddled,  because he  suddenly  startedaddressing someone  who was  not on-stage, and responded for this absent onehimself, calling himself now  dear sir,  now baron, now father, now son, nowformally, and now familiarly.     Nikanor  Ivanovich understood only one thing,  that  the actor died  anevil death, crying out:  'Keys! My keys!', after  which  he collapsed on thefloor, gasping and carefully tearing off his tie.     Having  died,  Kurolesov got  up,  brushed  the dust from his trousers,bowed  with  a  false  smile,  and  withdrew  to  the accompaniment of  thinapplause. And the master of ceremonies began speaking thus:     'We have just  heard  The Covetous Knight  wonderfully performed by SawaPotapovich. This  knight  hoped that frolicking nymphs would come running tohim, and that many other pleasant things in the same vein would  occur. But,as you  see,  none of  it happened, no nymphs  came running to him,  and themuses paid him no tribute, and he raised no mansions, but, on the contrary,ended  quite badly, died of  a  stroke,  devil  take  him, on  his chest  ofcurrency and jewels. I warn  you that the same sort of  thing, if not worse,is going to happen to you if you don't turn over your currency!'     Whether Pushkin's poetry produced such an effect, or it was the prosaicspeech of the master  of ceremonies, in any case a shy  voice  suddenly camefrom the house:     'I'll turn over my currency.'     'Kindly  come to the  stage,'  the  master  of  ceremonies  courteouslyinvited, peering into the dark house.     On-stage appeared a short,  fair-haired  citizen, who, judging  by  hisface, had not shaved in about three weeks.     'Beg pardon, what is your name?' the master of ceremonies inquired.     'Kanavkin, Nikolai,' the man responded shyly.     'Ah! Very pleased. Citizen Kanavkin. And so? ...'     'I'll turn it over,' Kanavkin said quiedy.     'How much?'     'A thousand dollars and twenty ten-rouble gold pieces.'     'Bravo! That'sall, then?'     The programme announcer stared straight into  Kanavkin's  eyes,  and iteven  seemed  to Nikanor  Ivanovich  that  those  eyes  sent  out rays  thatpenetrated Kanavkin like X-rays. The house stopped breathing.     'I  believe  you!' the artiste  exclaimed finally and extinguished  hisgaze. I  do! These eyes are not  lying! How many times  have I told you thatyour basic error  consists in underestimating the significance of the  humaneye. Understand  that  the tongue can  conceal  the  truth, but  the eyes --never! A sudden question is put to you, you don't even flinch, in one secondyou get  hold of yourself and know  what  you must say to conceal the truth,and you speak quite convincingly, and not a wrinkle on your face moves,  but-- alas --  the  truth which the question  stirs up  from the bottom of yoursoul leaps momentarily into your eyes, and  it's  all over! They see it, andyou're caught!'     Having delivered, and with great ardour, this highly convincing speech,the artiste tenderly inquiredof Kanavkin:     'And where is it hidden?'     With my aunt, Porokhovnikova, on Prechistenka.'     'Ah! That's ... wait . .. that's Klavdia Ilyinishna, isn't it?'     'Yes.'     'Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes! A separate little house? A little front gardenopposite? Of course, I know, I know! And where did you put it there?'     'In the cellar, in a candy tin . ..'     The artiste clasped his hands.     'Have you ever seen the like?' he cried out, chagrined. "Why, it'll getdamp and mouldy there! Is it conceivable to entrust currency to such people?Eh? Sheer childishness! By God! ...'     Kanavkin himself  realized he had fouled up and  was  in for it, and hehung his tufty head.     'Money,' the  artiste went  on, 'must be  kept in the  state  bank,  inspecial dry and  well-guarded rooms, and  by no means in some aunt's cellar,where it may, in particular, suffer damage from  rats! Really, Kanavkin, forshame! You're a grown-up!'     Kanavkin no longer knew what to do  with himself, and  merely picked atthe lapel ofhis jacket with his finger.     'Well,  all  right,' the artiste relented,  'let bygones be ...' And hesuddenly added  unexpectedly: 'Ah, by the way ... so that in one ... to savea trip ... this same aunt also has some, eh?'     Kanavkin,  never  expecting  such a turn of affairs,  wavered, and  thetheatre fell silent.     'Ehh, Kanavkin...' the  master of ceremonies said in  tender  reproach,'and here I was praising him! Look,  he just went  and  messed it up  for noreason  at all!  It's  absurd, Kanavkin!  Wasn't  I just talking about eyes?Can't we see that the aunt has got some?  Well, then  why  do you torment usfor nothing?'     'She has!' Kanavkin cried dashingly.     'Bravo!' cried the master of ceremonies.     'Bravo!' the house roared frightfully.     When  things  quieted  down,  the  master  of  ceremonies congratulatedKanavkin, shook his hand,  offered him a ride home to the city in a car,  andtold someone in the  wings to go in  that same car to fetch the aunt and askher kindly to come for the programmeat the women's theatre.     'Ah,  yes, I wanted to ask you,  has  the aunt ever mentioned where shehides  hers?'  the  master  of  ceremonies  inquired,  courteously  offeringKanavkin a  cigarette  and a lighted match. As  he  lit up,  the man grinnedsomehow wistfully.     'I believe you, I believe you,' the artiste responded with a sigh. 'Notjust  her nephew,  the old pinchfist wouldn't tell the  devil himself! Well,so, we'll  try  to  awaken some human feelings  in  her.  Maybe not all  thestrings have rotted in her usurious little soul. Bye-bye, Kanavkin!'     And  the  happy Kanavkin drove off. The artiste inquired  whether therewere  any others  who wished to turn over their  currency,  but was answeredwith silence.     'Odd birds, by God!' the artiste said,  shrugging, and the  curtain hidhim.     The lights went out,  there  was  darkness  for  a  while, and  in it anervous tenor was heard singing from far away:     There great heaps of  gold do shine, and all those  heaps  of  gold aremine ..."    Then twice the sound of subdued applause came from somewhere.     'Some little lady in the women's theatre is turning hers over,' NikanorIvanovich's  red-bearded neighbour  spoke up unexpectedly,  and added with asigh:  'Ah,  if it  wasn't  for my geese! ..  . I've  got fighting  geese inLianozovo,  my dear  fellow  . ..  they'll  die without  me,  I'm afraid.  Afighting bird's delicate, it needs care ... Ah, if it wasn't for my geese!     '...  They won't surprise  me with  Pushkin...' And again he  began  tosigh.     Here the  house  lit  up brightly, and  Nikanor Ivanovich  dreamed thatcooks in white  chef's hats and with ladles in their hands came pouring fromall the doors. Scullions  dragged  in a cauldron of  soup  and a  stand withcut-up rye bread. The spectators livened up.  The jolly cooks shuttled amongthe theatre buffs, ladled out bowls of soup, and distributed bread.     'Dig in, lads,' the cooks shouted, 'and turn over your currency! What'sthe point of sitting  here? Who wants to slop up this swill!Go home, have agood drink, a little bite, that's the way!'     'Now, you, for instance,  what're  you  doing sitting  here, old  man?"Nikanor   Ivanovich  was   directly   addressed  by   a  fat  cook  with   araspberry-coloured neck,  as  he offered him a bowl in which  a lone cabbageleaf floated in some liquid.     'I don't have any! I don't! I don't!' Nikanor  Ivanovich cried out in aterrible voice. 'YOU understand, I don't!'     'YOU  don't?' the  cook  bellowed in  a menacing  bass. 'You don't?' heasked  in  a  tender woman's  voice. 'You  don't, you  don't,'  he  murmuredsoothingly, turning into the nurse Praskovya Fyodorovna.     She was gently shaking Nikanor Ivanovich  by the shoulder  as he moanedin his sleep. Then the cooks melted  away, and  the theatre with its curtainbroke up.  Through his  tears, Nikanor  Ivanovich  made out his  room in thehospital and two  people in white coats,  who were  by no means casual cooksgetting at people  with their advice, but the doctor and that same PraskovyaFyodorovna,who was holding not a bowl but a little dish covered with gauze,with a syringe lying on it.     'What  is  all this?' Nikanor  Ivanovich said  bitterly,  as  they weregiving  him the injection.  'I don't have  any and that's that! Let  Pushkinturn over his currency for them. I don't have any!'     'No,  you  don't,  you  don't,'  the kind-hearted Praskovya  Fyodorovnasoothed him, 'and if you don't, there's no more to be said.'     After  the injection, Nikanor  Ivanovich  felt  better and  fell asleepwithout any dreams.     But, thanks to his cries, alarm was communicated to room 120, where thepatient  woke up and began looking for his head, and to room 118, where  theunknown master became restless and wrung  his hands  in  anguish, looking atthe moon, remembering the last bitter  autumn night  of his life, a strip oflight under the basement door, and uncurled hair.     From room 118,  the  alarm flew by way of  the balcony to  Ivan, and hewoke up and began to weep.     But the doctor  quickly calmed all  theseanxious, sorrowing heads, andthey began to  fall asleep. Ivan  was  the last to become oblivious, as dawnwas already breaking over the river. After the medicine,  which suffused hiswhole body, calm  came like a wave and covered  him. His  body grew lighter,his head basked in the warm wind  of  reverie. He fell asleep, and the  lastwaking thing he heard was the pre-dawn  chirping of birds in the woods.  Butthey soon fell silent, and he began dreaming that the sun was already  goingdown  over  Bald Mountain,  and the mountain was cordoned  off  by a  doublecordon ...
CHAPTER 16. The Execution        The sun was already going down over Bald Mountain, and the mountain wascordoned off by a double cordon.     The cavalry ala that  had cut across the  procurator's path around nooncame  trotting  up to the Hebron gate of the city. Its way had  already beenprepared.   The  infantry   of  the  Cappadocian  cohort   had   pushed  theconglomeration  of  people,  mules  and camels to the  sides, and  the  ala,trotting  and  raising  white  columns  of dust  in  the  sky,  came  to  anintersection where two roads met: the  south  road leading to Bethlehem, andthe north-west  road to  Jaffa. The ala raced down the north-west road.  Thesame Cappadocians were strung  out along the sides of the road, and in  goodtime had driven to the sides of  it  all the caravans hastening to the feastin Yershalaim.  Crowds  of  pilgrims stood behind the  Cappadocians,  havingabandoned their temporary striped  tents, pitched right on the  grass. Goingon for  about  a half-mile, the ala caught up with the second  cohortof theLightning legion and, having  covered another half-mile, was  the  first  toreach the foot of  Bald Mountain. Here they dismounted. The  commander brokethe ala up into  squads, and  they cordoned off the  whole foot of the smallhill, leaving open only the way up from the Jaffa road.     After some dme, the  ala  was joined  at the hill by the second cohort,which climbed one level higher and also encircled the hill in a wreath.     Finally the  century  under the  command  of Mark Ratslayer arrived. Itwent stretched  out in files along the sides of the road,  and between thesefiles, convoyed by the secret guard, the three condemned men rode in a cart,white boards hanging around  their necks with 'robber and rebel' written  oneach of them in two languages -- Aramaic and Greek.     The  cart with  the condemned  men was  followed by  others laden  withfreshly hewn posts  with crosspieces, ropes, shovels, buckets  and axes. Sixexecutioners  rode  in these carts. They were  followed on  horseback by thecenturionMark, the chief  of the temple guard of Yershalaim,  and that samehooded man with whom  Pilate  had had a momentary meeting in a darkened roomof the palace.     A file of soldiers brought up the rear of the procession, and behind itwalked about two thousand of the curious, undaunted by the infernal heat andwishing to be  present at  the interesting spectacle. The curious  from  thecity  were now  joined by  the  curious from among  the  pilgrims, who  wereadmitted without  hindrance to the tail of  the procession. Under the shrillcries of the heralds who accompanied the column and cried aloud  what Pilatehad cried out at around noon, the procession drew itself up Bald Mountain.     The  ala admitted everyone to the  second level, but the second centurylet  only  those  connected with the  execution  go  further up,  and  then,manoeuvring quickly, spread the crowd around the entire hill, so that peoplefound  themselves between the  cordons  of infantry above and cavalry below.Now they could watch the execution throughthe sparse line of the infantry.     And so, more than three hours had gone  by since the procession climbedthe mountain, and the sun was already going down over Bald Mountain, but theheat was still unbearable,  and  the soldiers in both cordons  suffered fromit, grew  weary  with boredom, and cursed the three robbers in their hearts,sincerely wishing them the speediest death.     The little commander of the  ala,  his  brow moist and the back of  hiswhite shirt  dark with sweat, having  placed himself at the foot of the hillby the  open  passage, went over to the leather  bucket of the  first  squadevery now and then,  scooped handfuls of water from it, drank and wetted histurban. Somewhat relieved by that, he would step away and again begin pacingback and forth on the dusty road leading to  the top. His long sword slappedagainst his laced leather boot. The commander wished to give  his cavalrymenan example of endurance, but, pitying his soldiers, he allowed them to sticktheir spears pyramid-like  in  the  groundand throw their white cloaks overthem. Under these tents, the Syrians hid from the merciless sun. The bucketswere quickly emptied, and cavalrymen  from different squads took turns goingto  fetch water in the gully  below the hill,  where  in the  thin  shade ofspindly  mulberries a  muddy  brook  was  living  out  its last  days in thedevilish  heat.  There, too,  catching the  unsteady shade,  stood the boredhorse-handlers, holding the quieted horses.     The weariness  of the soldiers and the abuse they  aimed at the robberswere understandable. The procurator's apprehensions concerning the disordersthat might occur at  the time of the execution in the city of Yershalaim, sohated by  him, fortunately were not borne out. And when the  fourth hour  ofthe  execution came, there was, contrary  to all expectations, not  a singleperson left between the two files, the infantry above and the cavalry below.The sun had scorched the crowd and driven it back to Yershalaim. Beyond  thefile of two Roman centuries there wereonly two dogs that belonged to no oneknew whom  and had for some reason ended up on the hill. But the heat got tothem,  too,  and they lay down  with their  tongues hanging out, panting andpaying no attention to  the green-backed lizards, the only beings not afraidof the  sun, darting among the scorching stones and some sort of big-thornedplants that crept on the ground.     No one  attempted to rescue  the condemned  men  either  in  Yershalaimitself, flooded with troops, or here on the cordoned-off hill, and the crowdwent back to  the city, for  indeed there was absolutely nothing interestingin  this execution, while there in the  city preparations were under way forthe great feast of Passover, which was to begin that evening.     The  Roman infantry  on  the  second level suffered still more than thecavalry. The only thing the centurion Ratslayer allowed his soldiers was  totake off their helmets  and cover their heads with white headbands dipped inwater,  but he kept them standing, and with their spears  intheir hands. Hehimself, in  the  same kind of headband, but dry, not wet, walked  about notfar  from the  group of executioners, without even taking the silver plaqueswith lions' muzzles off his shirt, or removing his greaves, sword and knife.The sun beat straight down on the centurion without doing  him any harm, andthe  lions' muzzles were impossible to look at -  the eyes were  devoured bythe dazzling gleam of the silver which was as if boiling in the sun.     Ratslayer's mutilated face expressed neither weariness nor displeasure,and it seemed that the giant centurion  was capable of pacing like  that allday, all night  and the  next day -  in short, for as  long as necessary. Ofpacing in the same way,  holding his hands to the heavy belt with its bronzeplaques, glancing in the same stern way  now  at the posts with the executedmen, now at the file of  soldiers, kicking  aside with the  toe of  a shaggyboot  in  the same  indifferent way  human  bones whitened by time  or smallflints that happened under hisfeet.     That  man in the hood  placed  himself  not  far from the  posts  on  athree-legged stool and sat there in complacent morionlessness, though pokingthe sand with a twig from time to time out of boredom.     What has  been said  about  there  not being a single person beyond thefile of legionaries  is  not quite true. There was one person, but he simplycould not be seen by everyone. He had placed himself,  not on the side wherethe way up  the  mountain was open and from  where it would  have been  mostconvenient to  watch the  execution, but on  the north side, where the slopewas  not gentle and accessible, but uneven, with gaps and clefts, where in acrevice,  clutching at  the heaven-cursed  waterless soil, a sickly fig treewas trying to live.     Precisely under  it, though it  gave no  shade, this sole spectator whowas not a participant in the execution had established  himself, and had saton a stone from  the very beginning, that is, for over three hours now. Yes,he had  chosen  not  the  best but the  worst  position  for  watching  theexecution.  But still, even from there the  posts could be  seen,  and therecould also be seen,  beyond the file of soldiers, the two dazzling spots  onthe  centurion's chest, and that  was apparently quite enough for  a man whoobviously wished to remain little noticed and not be bothered by anyone.     But  some four hours ago,  at the start of  the execution, this man hadbehaved quite differently,  and might have been noticed very well, which wasprobably why he had now changed his behaviour and secluded himself.     It was  only when the procession came to the very top, beyond the file,that  he had  first appeared, and as  an obvious latecomer  at  that. He wasbreathing hard, and did not walk but ran up the hill, pushing  his way, and,seeing  the file close together before  him as before everyone  else, made anaive attempt, pretending  he did not understand the angry shouts, to  breakthrough the soldiers to the very place of execution, where the condemned menwere alreadybeing taken from the cart. For that he received a heavy blow inthe  chest with  the  butt  end  of  a spear,  and he  leaped back  from thesoldiers, crying  out not in pain but  in despair. At the legionary who  haddealt the  blow he cast a  dull  glance, utterly indifferent  to everything,like a man insensible to physical pain.     Coughing and breathless, clutching  his chest, he ran  around the hill,trying to find some  gap in the file on  the north side where he  could slipthrough.  But it was  too  late, the ring was closed.  And the man, his facedistorted with grief, was forced to  renounce his attempts  to break throughto the carts, from which the posts had already been unloaded. These attemptswould  have led nowhere,  except that  he would  have been seized, and to bearrested on that day by no means entered his plans.     And so he  went to the side, towards  the crevice, where it was quieterand nobody bothered him.     Now, sitting on  the stone, this  black-bearded man, his eyes festeringfrom the sunand lack of sleep, was in anguish. First he sighed, opening histallith, worn out in his wanderings, gone from light-blue to dirty grey, andbared his  chest, which had been hurt by the spear and down which ran  dirtysweat;  then, in  unendurable pain, he raised his eyes to the sky, followingthe  three vultures that had long been  floating in  great  circles on high,anticipating  an imminent feast; then he peered with hopeless eyes into  theyellow earth, and  saw on it  the half-destroyed skull of a dog  and lizardsscurrying around it.     The man's sufferings were so great that  at times  he began talking  tohimself.     'Oh, fool that I am . ..' he muttered, swaying on the stone in the painof his heart and clawing his swarthy  chest with his nails. 'Fool, senselesswoman, coward! I'm not a man, I'm carrion!'     He would  fall silent,  hang his  head, then,  after drinking some warmwater from a wooden flask, he would revive again and clutch now at the knifehidden on his chest under the tallith, now at the  pieceof parchment  lyingbefore him on the stone next to a stylus and a pot of ink.     On this parchment some notes had already been scribbled:     The minutes run on, and I, Matthew Levi, am here  on Bald Mountain, andstill no death!'     Further:     The sun is sinking, but no death.'     Now Matthew Levi wrote hopelessly with the sharp stylus:     'God! Why are you angry with him? Send him death.'     Having written this, he sobbed  tearlessly and again wounded his  chestwith his nails.     The reason  for Levi's  despair lay in the terrible misfortune that hadbefallen Yeshua and him and, besides that, in the grave error that he, Levi,in  his own opinion, had committed.  Two  days earlier, Yeshua and  Levi hadbeen in Bethphage near Yershalaim, where they had visited a certain gardenerwho liked Yeshua's preaching very much. The two visitors had spent the wholemorning  working  in the garden, helping  their  host, and  planned to go toYershalaim towards evening when it cooled off. But Yeshua began to hurry forsomereason, said he had urgent business  in the city, and left alone aroundnoontime.  Here lay  Matthew Levi's  first error. Why, why had he let him goalone!     Nor was Matthew Levi to go to Yershalaim that evening. He was struck bysome unexpected and terrible ailment. He began to shake, his whole  body wasfilled with fire, his teeth chattered, and he kept asking to  drink  all thetime.     He  could  not go  anywhere.  He collapsed on  a horse blanket  in  thegardener's shed and lay there till dawn on Friday, when the illness releasedLevi as unexpectedly as it had fallen upon him. Though he was still weak andhis  legs  trembled,  he took  leave of his  host  and,  oppressed  by  someforeboding of  disaster,  went  to  Yershalaim.  There he learned  that  hisforeboding  had not deceived him -  the disaster occurred.  Levi  was in thecrowd and heard the procurator announce the sentence.     When the condemned men were led off  to the mountain,  Matthew Levi ranalongside the file in the crowd of the curious, tryingto let Yeshua know insome  inconspicuous way that at least he, Levi, was there with  him, that hehad not abandoned him  on his  last  journey,  and that  he was praying thatdeath would overtake Yeshua as soon as possible. But Yeshua, who was lookinginto the  distance towards  where he was being taken, of course did  not seeLevi.     And then,  when the  procession  had gone  about a half-mile  along theroad,  a simple  and  ingenious  thought dawned  on Matthew, who  was  beingjostled by the crowd just next to the file, and in his excitement he at onceshowered himself with curses for not having thought of it  earlier. The fileof soldiers  was  not solid, there were  spaces  between them.  Given  greatdexterity and a precise calculation, one  could bend  down, slip between twolegionaries, make  it to  the cart and jump into  it.  Then Yeshua would  besaved from suffering.     One instant would be  enough to stab Yeshua in the back  with  a knife,crying to him:  'Yeshua!  I  save  you  and go  with you!  I,  Matthew,yourfaithful and only disciple!'     And if God granted  him  one more free instant, he would also have timeto stab himself and avoid death on a post. This last, however, was of littleinterest  to Levi, the former tax  collector. He  was indifferent to  how hedied. He wanted one thing, that Yeshua, who had never in his  life done  theleast evil to anyone, should escape torture.     The plan was  a very good one, but the fact of the matter was that Levihad no knife with him. Nor did he have a single piece of money.     Furious with  himself,  Levi got  out of the crowd and ran back  to thecity.  A single feverish  thought was leaping  in his burning  head: how  toprocure a  knife there in  the city, in any way possible, and have  time  toovertake the procession.     He ran up  to the  city gate, manoeuvring amid the  throng  of caravansbeing  sucked  into the city, and saw to his left the open door of  a littleshop where bread was  sold. Breathing  hard after running  down the scorchedroad, Levi got control  ofhimself, entered the shop very sedately,  greetedthe woman behind the counter, asked her to take the top loaf from the shelf,which for some reason he liked better than the  others, and  when she turnedaround, silendy  and quickly  took  from the  counter that than  which therecould  be nothing better - a long,  razor-sharp bread  knife  - and at  oncedashed out of the shop.     A  few moments later he was again on the Jaffa road. But the processionwas no longer in sight. He ran. At  times  he had to drop down  right in thedust and lie motionless to recover his breath. And so he would lie there, tothe astonishment of people riding on mules or walking on foot to Yershalaim.He would lie listening to his heart  pounding not only in  his chest but  inhis head  and ears.  Having recovered his breath a little, he  would jump upand continue running, but  ever  slower and slower. When  he finally  caughtsight of the long procession raising dust in the distance, it was already atthe foot of the hill.     'Oh, God!  . . .'Levi  moaned,  realizing that he was going  to be toolate. And he was too late.     When the fourth hour  of  the execution had  gone  by,  Levi's tormentsreached their highest degree and  he  fell into a rage. Getting  up from thestone, he flung to the ground the  stolen knife - stolen in  vain, as he nowthought - crushed the flask with his foot, depriving himself of water, threwoff his kefia, seized his thin hair, and began cursing himself.     He  cursed  himself, calling  out meaningless words, growled and  spat,abused his father and mother for bringing a fool into the world.     Seeing  that  curses  and  abuse  had  no  effect  and  nothing in  thesun-scorched place  was changed by  them,  he clenched his dry fists, raisedthem, squinting,  to  the  sky,  to  the  sun that was  sliding ever  lower,lengthening the  shadows and  going  to  fall into  the  Mediterranean,  anddemanded an immediate miracle from  God. He demanded that  God  at once sendYeshua death.     Opening his  eyes, he became convinced thateverything on the  hill wasunchanged, except that  the  blazing spots on the centurion's chest had goneout.  The sun was sending its  rays into the backs of the  executed men, whowere facing Yershalaim. Then Levi shouted:     'I curse you. God!'     In  a rasping voice he shouted that he was convinced of God's injusticeand did not intend to believe in him any longer.     Tou  are deaf!' growled Levi. 'If  you  were  not deaf,  you would haveheard me and killed him straight away!'     Shutting his eyes, Levi waited  for the fire that would  fall from  thesky and strike him instead. This did  not happen, and  Levi, without openinghis  eyes,  went on  shouting offensive and sarcastic things at the  sky. Heshouted about his  total disappointment, about the existence of  other  godsand  religions. Yes, another god  would not have  allowed it, he would neverhave allowed a man like Yeshua to be burnt by the sun on a post.     'I was mistaken!'  Levi cried in a completely hoarse voice. 'YOU are  agod of evil! Or are youreyes completely  clouded by  smoke from  the templecensers,  and have your  ears ceased  to hear  anything but  the  trumpetingnoises of the  priests? You  are not an almighty god! You are a black god! Icurse you, god of robbers, their soul and their protector!'     Here something  blew into the face  of  the former  tax  collector, andsomething rustled under his feet.  It blew once more, and  then, opening hiseyes,  Levi saw that, either  under the influence of his curses, or owing toother reasons, everything in  the world was changed. The sun had disappearedbefore reaching the sea, where it sank every evening. Having swallowed it, astorm cloud  was rising  menacingly and inexorably  against the  sky  in thewest. Its edges were already seething with white foam, its black smoky bellywas tinged with  yellow. The storm  cloud was growling, threads of fire fellfrom it now and again. Down the  Jaffa road, down the meagre  Hinnom valley,over the tents  of the pilgrims, driven by the  suddenly risen wind, pillarsof dustwent flying.     Levi fell silent,  trying to grasp  whether the storm that was about tocover  Yershalaim would  bring any  change  in the  fate of the  unfortunateYeshua. And straight away,  looking  at the threads  of  fire cutting up thecloud, he  began to  ask that  lightning  strike Yeshua's  post. Repentantlylooking into the clear sky that had  not yet been devoured by the cloud, andwhere  the  vultures  were veering on  one wing to escape  the  storm,  Levithought he had been insanely hasty with his curses: now God was not going tolisten to him.     Turning his gaze to the foot of the hill, Levi fixed on the place wherethe strung-out cavalry regiment stood, and saw that considerable changes hadtaken place there. From above, Levi  was able to distinguish  very well  thesoldiers bustling about, pulling  spears out  of the ground, throwing cloakson,  the horse-handlers  trotting towards the road  leading black  horses bytheir bridles.  The regiment  was moving off,  that was clear.  Spitting andshielding himselfwith  his  hand from the dust blowing  in  his  face, Levitried to grasp  what it might  mean  if the cavalry  was about  to leave. Heshifted  his gaze  further up  and made  out  a little figure  in  a crimsonmilitary chlamys climbing  towards the place of execution. And here  a chillcame over  the  heart  of the  former  tax collector in  anticipation of thejoyful end.     The  man  climbing the  mountain  in the  fifth  hour  of the  robbers'sufferings  was the commander  of the cohort, who  had  come  galloping fromYershalaim accompanied by an aide. At a gesture  from Ratslayer, the file ofsoldiers parted, and  the centurion saluted the tribune.  The latter, takingRatslayer aside,  whispered something  to  him. The centurion  saluted him asecond time and moved towards the group of executioners, who were sitting onstones  at the  foot of the posts. The tribune meanwhile  directed his stepstowards  the  one  sitting  on  the three-legged  stool, and the  seated manpolitely rose to meet the tribune. And the tribune said something to him ina low voice, and the two  went  over  to the posts. They were joined  by thehead of the temple guard.     Ratslayer, casting  a squeamish sidelong glance at the dirty rags lyingon the ground  near the  posts, rags that  had  recently been the criminals'clothing,  and which  the executioners had rejected, called two of them  andordered:     'Follow me!'     From the nearest post came a hoarse, senseless song. Gestas, hanging onit, had lost his mind from the flies and sun  towards the end  of  the thirdhour, and was  now quiedy  singing something  about  grapes,  but his  head,covered with a turban, occasionally swayed all the same,  and then the fliesrose sluggishly from his face and setded on it again.     Dysmas, on the second post, suffered more than die other two because hedid  not   lose   consciousness,  and  he  swung  his  head  constantly  andrhythmically, right and left, so diat his ears struck his shoulders.     Yeshua  was more fortunate than the other two. In  die very firsthour,he began to have blackouts, and then he fell into oblivion, hanging his headin  its unwound turban.  The  flies  and  horseflies  dierefore covered  himcompletely, so that his face disappeared under die black swarming  mass.  Inhis groin, and on his belly,  and in his armpits, fat horseflies sat suckingat his yellow naked body.     Obeying  the gestures of the  man in the hood, one of the  executionerstook  a spear and anodier brought a bucket and  a  sponge  to die post.  Thefirst executioner raised the spear  and  with it  tapped first one, then theother of Yeshua's arms,  stretched out and bound widi  ropes to die crossbarof  the  post.  The  body,  with  its  protruding  ribs, gave a  start.  Theexecutioner passed die tip of the  spear over the  belly. Then Yeshua raisedhis head, and the flies  moved off with  a  buzz, revealing  the face of thehanged man, swollen with bites, the eyes puffy, an unrecognizable face.     Ungluing his  eyelids, Ha-Nozri looked down. His  eyes,  usually clear,were slighdyclouded.     'Ha-Nozri!' said the executioner.     Ha-Nozri moved his swollen Ups and answered in a hoarse robber's voice:     'What do you want? Why have you come to me?'     'Drink!' said the executioner, and a water-soaked sponge on die dp of aspear rose to Yeshua's lips. Joy flashed in his eyes, he clung to die spongeand began greedily imbibing  the  moisture. From the neighbouring post  camethe voice of Dysmas:     'Injustice! I'm a robber just like him!'     Dysmas strained  but  was unable  to move, his arms being bound  to thecrossbar in  three places with loops of rope. He  drew in his belly,  clawedthe ends of the  crossbar  widi his  nails,  kept  his head  turned  towardsYeshua's post, malice blazed in die eyes of Dysmas.     A dusty cloud covered the place, it became much  darker. When die  dustblew away, die centurion shouted:     'Silence on the second post!'     Dysmas fell  silent.  Yeshua  tore himself away from  die  sponge,  andtrying to make his  voice sound gende and persuasive, but not succeeding,hebegged the executioner hoarsely:     'Give him a drink.'     It  was growing ever darker. The  storm cloud had already poured acrosshalf the sky, aiming towards Yershalaim, boiling white clouds raced ahead ofthe storm cloud suffused with black moisture and fire. There was a flash anda thunderclap right over the hill. The  executioner removed  the sponge fromthe spear.     'Praise the  magnanimous  hegemon!' he  whispered solemnly,  and  gendypricked Yeshua in the heart. He twitched and whispered:     'Hegemon . . .'     Blood ran down his  belly, his lower  jaw twitched convulsively and hishead dropped.     At the second thunderclap, the executioner was already giving  Dysmas adrink, and with the same words:     'Praise the hegemon!' -- killed him as well.     Gestas,  deprived  of  reason,  cried out  fearfully  as  soon  as  theexecutioner  came  near him,  but when  the sponge  touched his  lips, he  'growled something  and seized  it  widi his teeth.  A few seconds later  hisbody, too, slumped as much asthe ropes would allow.     The  man in the hood followed the  executioner  and the centurion,  andafter him came the head of the temple guard. Stopping at die first post, theman  in die hood  examined the blood-covered Yeshua attentively, touched hisfoot with his white hand, and said to his companions:     'Dead.'     The same was repeated at die odier two posts.     After that the  tribune motioned to the centurion and, turning, startedoff die hilltop together with die head of the temple guard and the man in mehood.  Semi-darkness  set  in, and lightning farrowed  the black  sky.  Firesuddenly sprayed out of it, and die centurion's shout:  'Raise the cordon!',was drowned  in  rumbling. The happy soldiers rushed headlong down the hill,putting on their helmets.     Darkness covered Yershalaim.     Torrents of  rain poured down suddenly and caught the centuries halfwaydown the hill. The deluge fell so  terribly  that the soldiers  were alreadypursued by raging streams as they ran downhill. Soldiers slipped and fellinthe sodden clay, hurrying to get to the level road, along which - now barelyvisible through the sheet  of water  - the  thoroughly  drenched cavalry washeading  for Yershalaim.  A few  minutes later only one man remained in  thesmoky brew of storm, water and fire on the hill.     Shaking the not uselessly stolen knife, falling  from  slippery ledges,clutching  at whatever  was  there,  sometimes  crawling  on  his  knees, hestrained  towards the  posts. He  now vanished  in total  darkness,  now wassuddenly illumined by a tremulous light.     Having made his way to the posts, already up to his ankles in water, hetore  off his heavy water-soaked  taUith,  remaining just in his  shirt, andclung to Yeshua's feet. He  cut the  ropes on his shins, stepped  up  on thelower crossbar, embraced Yeshua and freed his arms from the upper bonds. Thenaked,  wet body  of Yeshua collapsed on Levi and brought him to the ground.Levi wanted to heave  it on to his shoulders straight away, but some thoughtstopped him.  He left  thebody with its thrown-back head and outspread armson the ground in the water, and ran, his feet slithering apart in the clayeymire, to  the other posts. He  cut  the ropes on them  as well, and the  twobodies collapsed on the ground.     Several minutes  passed,  and all that remained on the  top of the hillwas these two bodies and the three empty posts. Water beat on the bodies androlled them over.     By  that time both Levi  and the  body of  Yeshua  were  gone  from thehilltop.
CHAPTER 17. An Unquiet Day        On Friday morning, that is, the day after the  accursed seance, all theavailable  staff  of  the  Variety  -- the  bookkeeper  Vassily  StepanovichLastochkin,  two accountants,  three  typists,  both box-office  girls,  themessengers,  ushers, cleaning women  -- in short, all those available,  werenot  at  their  places  doing  their  jobs,  but  were  all sitting  on  thewindow-sills  looking out on Sadovaya and watching what  was going on by thewall of the Variety. By  this  wall a queue  of many thousands clung in  tworows, its tail reaching to Kudrinskaya Square. At the head of the line stoodsome two dozen scalpers well known to theatrical Moscow.     The  line behaved with much  agitation,  attracting  the notice  of thecitizens  streaming  past,   and   was  occupied  with  the   discussion  ofinflammatory  tales about  yesterday's unprecedented seance of  black magic.These same tales caused the greatest consternation in the bookkeeper VassilvStepanovich, who had not been present at the previousevening's performance.The  ushers  told  of God  knows  what,  among other things that  after  theconclusion of the famous seance, some female citizens went running around inthe street  looking quite indecent, and so on in  the same vein.  The modestand quiet Vassily Stepanovich merely blinked his eyes, listening to the talltales of these wonders, and  decidedly did not  know what to undertake,  andyet  something had to be  undertaken,  and precisely by  him, because he nowturned out to be the senior member of the whole Variety team.     By ten o'clock the line of  people desiring tickets had swelled so muchthat  rumour  of  it  reached  the  police,  and  with astonishing swiftnessdetachments  were sent, both on foot  and mounted, to bring  this line  intosome sort of order. However, in itself  even  an orderly snake  a  half-milelong  presented  a  great temptation, and  caused  utter  amaze-ment  in thecitizens on Sadovaya.     That  was  outside, but  inside the  Variety things were  also none toogreat. Earlyin the morning the telephones began to ring and went on ringingwithout  interruption in  Likhodeev's  office,  in  Rimsky's office, at  thebookkeeper's, in the box office, and in Varenukha's office.     Vassily Stepanovich at first made some answer, the box-office girl alsoanswered, the ushers  mumbled something  into  the telephones, but then theystopped altogether, because to  questions of where  Likhodeev, Varenukha andRimsky were, there was decidedly no answer. At first they  tried  to get offby saying  'Likhodeev's at home',  but the reply to  this  was that they hadcalled him at home, and at home they said Likhodeev was at the Variety.     An agitated lady called, started asking for Rimsky, was advised to callhis wife, to which the receiver, sobbing, answered that she was his wife andthat  Rimskv was  nowhere to be found. Some sort of nonsense was  beginning.The cleaning  woman  had already told  everybody that  when she  came to thefindirector's office to  clean, she saw  the door wide open,  the lightson,the window to the garden broken, the armchair lying on the floor, and no onein the office.     Shortly  after ten o'clock,  Madame Rimsky burst  into the Variety. Shewas  sobbing and wringing her  hands. Vassily Stepanovich was  utterly at  aloss  and  did not know how to counsel  her.  Then at half past ten came thepolice. Their first and perfecdy reasonable question was:     "What's going on here, dozens? What's this all about?'     The team stepped  back, bringing forward the pale  and agitated VassilyStepanovich. He  had  to  call things by  their  names  and confess that theadministration  of   the  Variety  in  the  persons  of  the  director,  thefindirector and  the administrator had  vanished and no one knew where, thatthe master of  ceremonies had been taken  to  a  psychiatric  hospital afteryesterday's seance,  and that, to put it briefly, this  seance yesterday hadfrankly been a scandalous seance.     The sobbing Madame Rimsky, having been calmed down as much as possible,was sent  home, andthe greatest interest was shown in  the cleaning woman'sstory about  the shape in which the findirector's office had been found. Thestaff  were asked to go to their places and get  busy, and in  a short whilethe  investigation  appeared  in  the  Variety  building,  accompanied  by asharp-eared, muscular, ash-coloured dog with extremely intelligent eyes. Thewhisper spread at once among the Variety staff that the  dog was  none otherthan the famous Ace of  Diamonds.  And so it  was. His behaviour amazed themall.  The  moment  Ace  of Diamonds ran into  the findirector's  office,  hegrowled, baring his monstrous  yellow fangs, then crouched on his belly and,with some sort of look of anguish and at the same  dme of rage in his  eyes,crawled  towards the broken window. Overcoming his fear, he suddenly  jumpedup on the window-sill and, throwing back his  sharp muzzle,  howled savagelyand angrily. He refused  to leave the window, growled and twitched, and kepttrying to jump out.     The dog was taken from the officeand turned loose in the lobby, whencehe walked  out  through  the  main  entrance  to the  street  and led  thosefollowing  him  to the  cab  stand.  There  he lost  the  trail he  had beenpursuing. After that Ace of Diamonds was taken away.     The  investigation settled  in  Varenukha's  office,  where they  begansummoning  in  turn  all   the  Variety  staff  members  who  had  witnessedyesterday's events during the seance. It must be said that the investigationhad  at every step to  overcome  unforeseen difficulties.  The  thread  keptsnapping off in their hands.     There had been  posters, right? Right. But  during  the night they  hadbeen  pasted over  with new  ones, and now, strike me  dead,  there wasn't asingle  one  to be found! And the magician himself, where had he come  from?Ah, who knows! But there was a contract drawn up with him?     T suppose so,' the agitated Vassily Stepanovich replied.     'And if one was drawn up, it had to go through bookkeeping?'     'Most assuredly,' responded the agitatedVassily Stepanovich.     'Then where is it?'     'Not  here,'  the  bookkeeper  replied,  turning  ever  more  pale  andspreading his arms.     And indeed  no trace  of the contract  was found in  the files  of  thebookkeeping  office,  nor  at  the  findirector's,  nor  at  Likhodeev's  orVarenukha's.     And what was this magician's name? Vassily Stepanovich did not know, hehad  not  been  at  the  seance  yesterday. The ushers  did  not  know,  thebox-office girl wrinkled her  brow, wrinkled  it, thought  and thought,  andfinally said:     'Wo . . . Woland, seems like ...'     Or maybe not Woland? Maybe not Woland. Maybe Faland.     It turned  out that in the foreigners'  bureau they had heard preciselynothing  either  about  any Woland,  or for  that  matter  any  Faland,  themagician.     The  messenger  Karpov said  that  this  same  magician was  supposedlystaying  in Ukhodeev's apartment. The  apartment was, of  course, visited atonce -- no magician was found there. Likhodeev himself was not there either.Thehousekeeper  Grunya was  not there,  and where she had gone nobody knew.The chairman of the management, Nikanor Ivanovich, was not  there, Bedsornevwas not there!     Something   utterly   preposterous  was  coming  out:   the  whole  topadministration had  vanished, a strange, scandalous  seance  had taken placethe day before, but who had produced it and at whose prompting, no one knew.     And meanwhile it was drawing towards noon, when  the box office  was toopen.  But,  of  course, there could  be  no talk of  that! A huge piece  ofcardboard was straight  away posted on  the  doors of  the  Variety reading:'Today's Show Cancelled'. The line became agitated,  beginning at its  head,but after some agitation,  it nevertheless  began to break up,  and about anhour later no  trace of  it remained on Sadovava. The investigation departedto continue its work elsewhere,  the staff was sent  home, leaving only  thewatchmen, and the doors of the Variety were locked.     The bookkeeper Vassily  Stepanovich had urgentlyto perform  two tasks.First,  to  go  to the  Commission on  Spectacles  and Entertainment  of theLighter Type with  a report  on yesterday's events and, second, to visit theFinspectacle  sector  so as  to  turn over  yesterday's  receipts  -- 21,711roubles.     The precise  and  efficient Vassily  Stepanovich wrapped  the  money innewspaper,  criss-crossed it  with string,  put  it  in his briefcase,  and,knowing his instructions very  well, set out, of course, not  for a bus or atram, but for the cab stand.     The  moment  the  drivers of  the three  cabs saw a passenger  hurryingtowards  the  stand with a tighdy  stuffed briefcase,  all  three left emptyright under his nose, looking back at him angrily for some reason.     Struck  by  this circumstance, the bookkeeper stood  like a post for  along time, trying to grasp what it might mean.     About three minutes later, an empty cab drove up, but the driver's facetwisted the moment he saw the passenger.     'Are you free?' Vassily Stepanovich asked with a coughof surprise.     'Show your money,'  the  driver replied angrily, without looking at thepassenger.     With  increasing  amazement,  the  bookkeeper,  pressing  the  preciousbriefcase under his arm, pulled a ten-rouble bill from his wallet and showedit to the driver.     'I won't go!' the man said curtly.     'I beg your pardon ...'  the bookkeeper tried  to begin, but the driverinterrupted him.     'Got any threes?'     The completely bewildered bookkeeper took  two three-rouble bills  fromhis wallet and showed them to the driver.     'Get in,' he shouted, and slapped down the flag of the meter so that healmost broke it. 'Let's go!'     'No change, is that it?' the bookkeeper asked timidly.     'A  pocket full of  change!' the driver bawled,  and the  eyes  in  themirror  went  bloodshot.  'It's my  third  case today.  And the  same  thinghappened with the others, too. Some son of a bitch gives me a tenner, I givehim change -- four-fifty. He gets out, the scum! About five minutes later, Ilook: instead of a  tenner, it's a label from a seltzer bottle!'  Here  thedriver uttered several unprintable words. 'Another one, beyond Zubovskaya. Atenner.  I  give  him three roubles change. He  leaves. I  go to  my wallet,there's a  bee  there -- zap in the finger!  Ah, you! . .  .'  and again thedriver pasted on some unprintable  words. 'And no tenner.  Yesterday, in theVariety here'  (unprintable words), 'some vermin of a  conjurer did a seancewith ten-rouble bills' (unprintable words) ...     The bookkeeper went numb, shrank into himself, and pretended it was thefirst time  he had heard even the word 'Variety', while thinking to himself:'Oh-oh! . . .'     Having  got  where  he  had to  go,  having  paid  satisfactorily,  thebookkeeper  entered  the  building  and went  down  the corridor towards themanager's  office,  and realized  on  his way that he had come  at the wrongtime.  Some  sort  of  tumult  reigned  in  the  offices  of  the SpectaclesCommission. A  messenger  girl  ran past  the bookkeeper,  her  kerchief allpushedback on her head and her eyes popping.     'Nothing,  nothing,  nothing, my dears!' she shouted, addressing no oneknew whom. The jacket and trousers are there,  but inside the jacket there'snothing!'     She  disappeared through some  door, and straight  away from behind  itcame the  noise of smashing dishes.  The manager of the  commission's  firstsector, whom the  bookkeeper knew, ran out  of  the secretary's room, but hewas in such a state that he did not recognize the bookkeeper and disappearedwithout a trace.     Shaken by  all this, the bookkeeper reached the secretary's room, whichwas the anteroom  to the office of the  chairman of the commission, and herehe was definitively dumbfounded.     From behind the closed  door  of  the office  came  a  terrible  voice,undoubtedly belonging to Prokhor Petrovich, the chairman  of the commission.'Must  be  scolding  somebody!'  the  consternated bookkeeper  thought  and,looking around, saw something else:  in a  leather armchair, her head thrownback, sobbing unrestrainedly,a wet handkerchief in her hand, legs stretchedout into the middle of the  room, lay Prokhor Petrovich's personal secretary-- the beautiful Anna Richardovna.     Anna Richardovna's  chin was all  smeared with lipstick,  and down  herpeachy cheeks black  streams of sodden mascara flowed from her eyelashes.     Seeing  someone come in, Anna  Richardovna  jumped  up,  rushed  to thebookkeeper,  clutched  the  lapels of  his  jacket,  began  shaking  him andshouting:     'Thank God! At least one brave man  has been found! Everybody ran away,everybody betrayed us! Let's go,  let's go to him, I don't know what to do!'And, still sobbing, she dragged the bookkeeper into the office.     Once in the office, the bookkeeper first of all dropped his  briefcase,and  all the thoughts in his head turned upside-down. And,  it must be said,not without reason.     At a huge writing desk with.  a massive inkstand an empty  suit sat andwith a dry pen, not dipped in ink, traced on a  piece of paper. The suit waswearing  a necktie,  a fountain  pen stuck from  its pocket,  but above thecollar there was neither neck nor head, just as there were no hands stickingout of the sleeves. The suit was immersed in work and completely ignored theturmoil  that reigned  around it. Hearing someone come in,  the  suit leanedback  and  from  above the  collar  came the  voice,  quite familiar  to thebookkeeper, of Prokhor Petrovich:     'What is this? Isn't it written on the door that I'm not receiving?'     The beautiful secretary shrieked and, wringing her hands, cried out:      'YOU see? You see?! He's not there! He's not! Bring him back, bring himback!'     Here  someone  peeked in the door of the office, gasped, and flew  out.The bookkeeper  felt his legs  trembling and sat on the edge of a chair, butdid not forget to pick up his briefcase. Anna Richardovna hopped  around thebookkeeper, worrying his jacket, and exclaiming:     'I always, always stopped him when  he swore by  the devil! So now  thedevil's got him!' Here the beauty  ran to the  writing deskand in a tender,musical voice, slightly nasal from weeping, called out:     'Prosha! Where are you!'     'Who here is  "Prosha" to  you?' the  suit inquired haughtily,  sinkingstill deeper into the armchair.     'He doesn't recognize me! Me he doesn't!  Do  you understand? ...'  thesecretary burst into sobs.     'I ask you not to sob in the office!' the hot-tempered striped suit nowsaid angrily, and with its sleeve it drew to itself a fresh stack of papers,with the obvious aim of appending its decision to them.     'No, I can't look at it, I can't!' cried Anna Richardovna, and she  ranout  to  the secretary's  room,  and  behind  her,  like  a  shot, flew  thebookkeeper.     'Imagine, I'm sitting here,' Anna Richardovna  recounted,  shaking withagitation, again clutching at the  bookkeeper's sleeve, 'and a cat walks in.Black, big  as a behemoth. Of course, I shout "scat" to it. Out it goes, andin  comes  a fat fellow instead, also with a sort of cat-like mug, and says:"What are you  doing,citizeness, shouting 'scat' at visitors?" And - whoosh- straight to Prokhor Petrovich. Of course, I run after him,  shouting: "Areyou  out of  your mind?"  And  this  brazen-face goes  straight  to  ProkhorPetrovich and  sits  down opposite him in  the armchair. Well, that one  ...he's the kindest-hearted man, but edgy. He blew up, I don't deny it. An edgyman, works like an ox - he blew up. "Why do you barge  in here unannounced?"he says. And that brazen-face, imagine,  sprawls  in the armchair and  says,smiling:     "I've come," he says, "to discuss  a little business with you." ProkhorPetrovich blew up again: "I'm busy." And the other one, just think, answers:"You're  not busy  with anything . .."  Eh? Well,  here,  of course, ProkhorPetrovich's patience ran out, and he shouted: "What is all this? Get him outof here, devil take me!" And that one, imagine, smiles and says: "Devil takeyou? That, in  fact, can be done!" And -- bang!Before I had time to scream,I look: the one with the cat's mug is gone, and th .. . there .. . sits .. .the suit .  ..  Waaa!...'  Stretching her  mouth, which  had  lost all shapeentirely, Anna Richardovna howled.     After choking  with sobs, she caught her breath, but then began pouringout something completely incoherent:     'And it writes, writes, writes! You could lose your mind! Talks on  thetelephone! A suit! They all ran away like rabbits!'     The bookkeeper only  stood and shook.  But here  fate came to his  aid.Into  the secretary's room,  with  calm, business-like  strides, marched thepolice, to  the  number  of  two men. Seeing  them, the beauty sobbed  stillharder, jabbing towards the door of the office with her hand.     'Let's not  cry  now,  citizeness,'  the  first  said calmly,  and  thebookkeeper,  feeling  himself  quite  superfluous  there,  ran  out  of  thesecretary's room and a minute  later was already in the fresh air. There wassome  sort of draught in his head,  a soughing as in a chimney, and throughthis  soughing  he  heard  scraps  of the  stories  the  ushers  told  aboutyesterday's cat, who had taken part in the seance. 'Oh-ho-ho! Might that notbe our same little puss?'     Having  got nowhere  with  the  commission,  the  conscientious VassilyStepanovich decided to visit its affiliate, located in Vagankovsky Lane, andto calm himself a little he walked the distance to die affiliate on foot.     The affiliate for city spectacles  was housed in a peeling old  mansionset back from the street, and was  famous  for  the porphyry  columns in itsvestibule. But it was not the  columns that struck visitors to the affiliatethat day, but what was going on at the foot of them.     Several visitors  stood in stupefaction  and stared  at a  weeping girlsitting behind a small table on  which lay special literature  about variousspectacles, which the  girl sold. At that moment, the girl was not  offeringany of this  literature  to anyone, and only  waved  her hand at sympatheticinquiries, while atthe  same time, from above, from below,  from the sides,and from all sections of the affiliate poured the ringing of at least twentyoverwrought telephones.     After weeping for a while, the girl suddenly gave a start and cried outhysterically:     'Here it  comes again!' and unexpectedly began singing in  a  tremuloussoprano:     'Glorious sea, sacred Baikal. . .'[1]     A  messenger appeared  on  the  stairs, shook his fist at someone,  andbegan singing along with the girl in a dull, weak-voiced baritone:     'Glorious boat, a barrel of cisco .. .'[2]     The messenger's voice was joined by  distant voices, the choir began toswell, and  finally the song resounded in  all corners of the affiliate.  Inthe neighbouring room no. 6, which housed the account comptroller's section,one powerful, slightly husky octave stood out particularly.     'Hey, Barguzin[3] ...  make the  waves  rise  and  fall!...'bawled the messenger on the stairs.     Tears flowed down the girl's face,  she tried to clench her  teeth, buthermouth opened of itself, as she sang an octave higher than the messenger:     'This young lad's ready to frisk-o!'     What  struck  the  silent  visitors  to  the  affiliate  was  that  thechoristers, scattered in various places, sang quite harmoniously, as  if thewhole choir stood there with its eyes fixed on some invisible director.     Passers-by  in  Vagankovsky  Lane  stopped  by  the  fence of the yard,wondering at the gaiety that reigned in the affiliate.     As soon as the first verse came to an end, the singing suddenly ceased,again  as  if  to  a  director's  baton.  The  messenger  quiedy  swore  anddisappeared.     Here the front door  opened, and in it  appeared a citizen in  a summerjacket, from under which  protruded the skirts of a white coat, and with hima policeman.     'Take measures, doctor, I implore you!' the girl cried hysterically.     The secretary of  the  affiliate ran out to the  stairs and,  obviouslyburning with shame and embarrassment, began falteringly:     'You see, doctor, we have a case of some sort of mass hypnosis, and soit's  necessary that. . .' He did not finish the sentence, began to choke onhis words, and suddenly sang out in a tenor:     'Shilka and Nerchinsk . . .'[4]     'Fool!' the girl had time to shout, but, without explaining who she wasabusing,  produced instead a forced roulade and herself  began singing aboutShilka and Nerchinsk.     'Get  hold  of  yourself!  Stop  singing!'  the  doctor  addressed  diesecretary.     There was every indication  that the secretary would himself have givenanything  to stop singing, but stop singing he  could not, and together withthe choir he brought to the hearing of passers-by in  the lane the news that'in the wilderness he was not touched  by voracious  beast, nor brought downby bullet of shooters.'     The moment the verse ended, the girl was the first to receive a dose ofvalerian  from  the doctor,  who  then  ran after the  secretary to give theothers theirs.     'Excuse me,  dear citizeness,' Vassily Stepanovich  addressed thegirl,'did a black cat pay you a visit?'     'What  cat?'  the girl cried in anger. 'An ass, it's an ass  we've  gotsitting in  the affiliate!'  And  adding  to that: 'Let  him hear, I'll telleverything' -- she indeed told what had happened.     It turned out that the manager of  the  city affiliate, 'who has made aperfect mess of lightened entertainment' (the girl's words), suffered from amania for organizing all sorts of little clubs.     'Blew smoke in the authorities' eyes!' screamed the girl.     In the course of a year this manager had  succeeded in organizing a dubof Lermontov studies,' of chess and checkers, of ping-pong, and of horsebackriding. For the summer, he was threatening  to organize clubs of fresh-watercanoeing and alpinism. And  so today, during lunch-break, this manager comesin ...     '.. . with some son of a bitch on  his arm,' the girl went on, 'hailingfrom  nobody  knows  where,   in  wretched  checkered  trousers,  a  crackedpince-nez, and . . . with a completely impossible mug! . . .'    And  straight away,  the  girl  said,  he recommended him to  all thoseeating  in  the  affiliate's  dining  room  as  a  prominent  specialist  inorganizing choral-singing clubs.     The faces of the future alpinists darkened, but the manager immediatelycalled on everyone to cheer up, while the specialist joked a little, laugheda little, and  swore an oath  that singing  takes  no time at all, but that,incidentally, there was a whole load of benefits to be derived from it.     Well,  of course, as the girl said, the first to pop up were Fanov  andKosarchuk, well-known affiliate toadies, who announced that they would  signup. Here  the rest of the  staff  realized that there was no  way around thesinging, and they, too,  had to  sign up for the club.  They decided to singduring the lunch break, since the rest of the time was taken up by Lermontovand checkers. The manager, to set an example, declared that he  was a tenor,and   everything  after   that  went  as  in  a  bad  dream.  The  checkeredspecialist-choirmasterbawled out:     'Do,   mi,  sol,  do!'  -  dragged the  most  bashful  from  behind  thebookcases,  where  they  had tried  to  save themselves from  singing,  toldKosarchuk he had perfect pitch, began whining, squealing, begging them to bekind  to an  old  singing-master, tapped  the  tuning fork  on  his knuckle,beseeched them to strike up 'Glorious Sea'.     Strike  up they did. And  gloriously. The checkered one really knew hisbusiness. They finished the first  verse. Here the director excused himself,said:  'Back  in  a  minute  .. .', and disappeared. They  thought he  wouldactually come back  in  a minute. But  ten  minutes  went by and  he was notthere. The staff was overjoyed -- he had run away!     Then suddenly, somehow of themselves, they began the second verse. Theywere  all led by Kosarchuk, who may not have had perfect pitch, but did havea rather pleasant high tenor. They sang  it through. No director! They movedto  their places, but  had not managed to sit down when, against their will,they beganto sing.  To stop was impossible. After three minutes of silence,they would  strike up  again. Silence -- strike  up! Then they realized thatthey were in trouble. The manager locked himself in his office from shame!     Here the girl's story was interrupted -- the valerian had not done muchgood.     A quarter  of an hour  later,  three trucks  drove up to the  fence  inVagankovsky, and the entire staff of the affiliate, the manager at its head,was loaded on to them.     As  soon as the first truck, after lurching  in  the gateway, drove outinto the lane, the staff members, who were standing on  the platform holdingeach other's  shoulders, opened their  mouths, and the whole lane  resoundedwith the popular song. The second truck picked it up, then the third. And sothey drove  on. Passers-by hurrying about their own business would cast onlya fleeting glance at the trucks, not surprised in the least, thinking it wasa group excursion to the country. And they were indeed going to the country,though not on an excursion,but to Professor Stravinsky's clinic.     Half an hour later, the  bookkeeper, who had lost his head  completely,reached  the  financial sector, hoping finally to get rid of the  box-officemoney. Having  learned from experience by  now,  he first peeked  cautiouslyinto  the  oblong  hall  where,   behind  frosted-glass  windows  with  goldlettering, the staff was sitting. Here the bookkeeper discovered no signs ofalarm or scandal. It was quiet, as it ought to be in a decent institution.     Vassily Stepanovich  stuck his  head  through  the  window  with  'CashDeposits' written over it, greeted some unfamiliar clerk, and politely askedfor a deposit slip.     'What do you need it for?' the clerk in the window asked.     The bookkeeper was amazed.     'I want to turn over some cash. I'm from the Variety.'     'One moment,' the clerk replied and instantly closed the opening in thewindow with a grille.     'Strange!...'  thought  the  bookkeeper.  His  amazement  was perfectlynatural. It was the  first rime in his life that  he had  met with  such  acircumstance. Everybody knows  how hard it is to get  money; obstacles to itcan always be found. But there had been  no case in the bookkeeper's  thirtyyears of experience when anyone, either an official or a private person, hadhad a hard rime accepting money.     But at last  the  little grille  moved  aside, and the bookkeeper againleaned to the window.     'Do you have a lot?' the clerk asked.     'Twenty-one thousand seven hundred and eleven roubles.'     'Oho!' the  clerk answered ironically for  some  reason  and handed thebookkeeper a green slip.     Knowing the form well, the bookkeeper instantly filled it out and beganto untie the string  on the  bundle. When he unpacked  his  load, everythingswam before his eyes, he murmured something painfully.     Foreign money flitted before  his eyes: there were  stacks of  Canadiandollars, British pounds, Dutch guldens, Latvian lats, Estonian kroons . . .     'There he is,  one of  those tricksters from the  Variety!' a  menacingvoiceresounded over the dumbstruck  bookkeeper. And  straight away  VassilyStepanovich was arrested.
CHAPTER 18. Hapless Visitors        At the same time that the zealous bookkeeper was racing in a cab to hisencounter with the self-writing suit, from first-class sleeping car no. 9 ofthe Kiev train, on its  arrival in  Moscow, there alighted, among others,  adecent-looking   passenger  carrying  a   small  fibreboard  suitcase.  Thispassenger  was  none  other  than  the  late  Berlioz's  uncle,   MaximilianAndreevich Poplavsky,  an  industrial economist, who lived  in  Kiev  on theformer Institutsky Street. The reason for Maximilian Andreevich's coming  toMoscow was a telegram received late in the evening two days before  with thefollowing content:     Have  just  been run  over by tram-car  at Patriarch's  'Ponds  funeralFriday three pm come. Berlioz.     Maximilian Andreevich was considered one of the most intelligent men inKiev, and  deservedly  so. But even the most intelligent man might have beennonplussed  by such  a telegram. If  someone sends a telegram  saying he hasbeen  run over, it is clear that he has not died  of it.But then, what  wasthis about  a funeral? Or was he in a bad way and foreseeing death? That waspossible, but such precision was in the highest degree strange: how could heknow he would be buried on Friday at three pm? An astonishing telegram!     However, intelligence is granted to intelligent  people so as  to  sortout entangled affairs. Very simple. A mistake had been made, and the messagehad  been  distorted. The word 'have' had  undoubtedly come there from  someomer telegram  in place of the word 'Berlioz', which got moved and  wound upat the end  of  the telegram. With  such an emendation, the meaning  of  thetelegram became clear, though, of course, tragic.     When the  outburst of grief  that struck Maximilian  Andreevich's  wifesubsided, he at once started preparing to go to Moscow.     One secret  about Maximilian Andreevich ought  to be revealed.
